<p class='c009'>“When Tantalus,” said Janet, “was
standing in the water that he could not
reach, and was dying of thirst, a Philosopher
came by. ‘Don’t you understand,’
said the Philosopher, ‘that what you want
is <em>water</em>?’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean by that?” I asked,
turning to look at the girl’s face. Her
colour was shifting quickly in the cool
October air.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I mean,” she answered, with her lips
curling into her wickedest smile, “that I
have been talking with my cousin Paul.
He explained, with an air of giving information,
that what I need is faith.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your cousin Paul,” growled the Doctor,
“has a most remarkable way of discovering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>what the rest of us have always
known.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you always know that?” asked the
girl. “I had an idea that you thought I
needed a tonic.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s the ‘brotherhood of man,’”
the Doctor went on. “Your cousin Paul
thinks that he has discovered or invented
the ‘brotherhood of man.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you mean,” I suggested, “that
he discovers and acts upon what the rest
of us have always known without letting it
make any particular difference?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot see that he is trying any
harder than the rest of us to find out how
to treat his neighbour,” said the Doctor.
“Living in the slums is as comfortable
nowadays as living anywhere else. At
least, it is at Barnet House. That has
as good appointments as any house in the
city.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good plumbing isn’t quite everything,”
I ventured to say.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Those university men who go to live
with the poor are too supercilious,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>the Doctor. “They patronize humanity.
And the ‘cousin Paul’ doesn’t stop there.
He patronizes the Creator, too. He is
constantly reminding the Creator that He
is being recognized by one of the first
families.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Janet laughed. “You are clever,” she
said, “but you aren’t polite. Paul does
bend over a little in his efforts to help.
But his mother’s son could hardly avoid
that. Think of the family!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The whole thing is artificial,” continued
the Doctor. “Your cousin goes
to live in a tenement, tries to become
intimate with its inhabitants, and carries
up his own coal. He could never realize
that it would be just as lofty a course of
action to carry coal in his own house in
Endicott Square, and to become intimate
with his barber!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That would not be picturesque,” said
Janet.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a pause.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You say he patronizes the Creator,”
mused Janet. “Wouldn’t it be better to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>say that he interprets God and patronizes
man? I think that I dislike the former
more than the latter. He is so sure of
his beliefs. And he is so puzzled to know
how any one can doubt what he believes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Doctor changed the subject with,
“What you want is some work to do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl’s smile vanished, and her face
grew bitter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s the use of working,” she demanded,
“when it doesn’t mean anything?
You can never do the thing you want to
do. You can only do what somebody else
wants to do. I am tired of succeeding in
other people’s ambitions.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You haven’t had a great deal of experience
of that kind, have you?” asked
the Doctor.</p>

<p class='c010'>She did not listen. “The world is buttoned
up wrong,” she said, “just one hole
wrong. I get what you want, and somebody
else wants what you get. I believe
that hopes were given to us simply in order
to hurt. The gods must enjoy dangling
before our eyes, just out of reach, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>things we pray for. Probably they like to
see us clutching the air.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know how to ride a horse?”
asked the Doctor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you had better do it, and let the
gods alone. There is one good thing about
being on horseback: you can’t despair. If
you do, you fall off.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here we reached my door, and I went
in. I paused for a minute, to watch the
two women going down the street,—the
Doctor, with her free, even step; the girl
with quick, irregular movements.</p>

<p class='c010'>It seemed to me that Janet was the
most inexplicable of all the inexplicable
people I had met since my arrival, six
weeks ago. Something must have hurt
her cruelly. She saw all life in the light
of her own pain, and she rebelled against
the suffering whose ultimate meaning she
could not understand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet now, with the sunlight in her warm
brown hair, she looked, in her radiant colouring,
like a symbol of all the joy and
gladness in the world.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I had come to a strange city, to do a
peculiar work. At last—and I was thirty-nine
years old—I was free to render
humanity the service I had always wanted
to give.</p>

<p class='c010'>So I took up my Cause. What special
cause it was there is no need to say. It
was one of those that are never won while
the world sins on, and yet are never lost.</p>

<p class='c010'>The city was new to me. Its streets,
its spires, and its sky were all strange.</p>

<p class='c010'>But not so strange as its ideas. I found
that I had come to a centre of new notions,
and that my scheme was only one of many
for the salvation of mankind. All that
was most advanced was represented here:
new faiths, new co-operative experiments
in trade, new revelations of the occult.</p>

<p class='c010'>The men and women that I met filled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>me with astonishment. They were all
self-conscious and introspective. Most of
them were brooding over wrongs,—the
concrete wrongs of others, or their own
abstract injuries, in a world that hid from
them the great secret of existence. And
they were all devising ways and means to
correct the misdeeds of man and of God.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps it was the many theories that
lent a kind of unreality to the life in the
streets. I used almost to wonder if it
were a pantomime, arranged to illustrate
our ideas. Something certainly made the
thoroughfares and the houses in the city
look like scenery in a play, and I was
always half-expecting them to fold up and
move off the stage.</p>

<p class='c010'>The street on which I lived was especially
theatrical. Opposite was a house
consisting of one Gothic tower; the stucco
houses next, with their low windows and
gabled roofs, suggested Nürenburg. Near
by was a studio building, guarded by two
carven lions; and round the corner stood
a huge armoury, with a machicolated roof.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>It all looked like a mediæval background,
prepared for the tumult of a play.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the tumult never came. Nothing
ever disturbed us there except great
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c010'>If it had not been for the Cause, I
should have been lonely. Not that it was
especially companionable, but that it made
me acquainted with the Doctor and the
Altruist, and, in fact, with all the other
people, except the Lad, and the Man of
the World, and the Butterfly Hunter.
They were at my boarding-place.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Altruist was Janet’s cousin Paul.
It was he who introduced me to Janet, and
to her namesake, little Jean. They lived
opposite in one of the gray stucco houses.
Jean was a year-old baby, and her godmother
a young woman of twenty-four.</p>

<p class='c010'>I used often to see them together upstairs,
Jean’s yellow head shining against
her aunt’s brown hair. I liked to think of
them as I went wandering with my ideas
about abstract humanity through this
visionary town.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Altruist was terribly in earnest.
He considered our social system all wrong,
and he wrote and lectured and preached
about it constantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>He lived in one of the city slums.</p>

<p class='c010'>The morning after my arrival I went
down to the East End to ask him about
his work. I had heard much about him.
He had left a home of great beauty to
go to that sin-stricken corner of the city,
and the fame of his sacrifice had spread
abroad.</p>

<p class='c010'>I found him nailing a board to the steps
of the tenement-house where he lived.
He greeted me cordially, holding out a
small, shapely right hand in welcome.</p>

<p class='c010'>The house stood in a row of tall tenements,
near the terminus of an elevated
road. All round it the streets were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>swarming with children, Russian and Jewish
children, dirty, ragged, and forlorn.
Some of them were kicking dirt toward
the Altruist’s clean steps; others were
eyeing him with respectful curiosity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you do down here? How
can you help?” I asked when the Altruist
had seated me in his study. It was in the
rear of the building, on the ground floor,
and it looked out into a densely populated
court.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do? Oh, very little actual work. I
just live, for the most part,” he answered,
smiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>He still held in his hand the hammer
with which he had been working. I
watched him closely, as he sat in the
rough wooden chair in the bare, uncarpeted
room.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was a small man, with vivid blue
eyes and dark hair. There was a touch of
excitement in his manner, and I thought
I detected in his face a certain dramatic
interest in the situation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I live quietly in my rooms here,” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>continued. It was hard to hear his voice
above the noise of the court and the roar
of the elevated trains. “There is no organized
work that I am attempting. I have
even given up my church, in order that no
machinery may interfere with my purely
human relation to my neighbours. I am
trying simply to lead a normal life among
my brethren. I study; I make calls and
receive them. There is nothing extraordinary
in the situation. I merely choose my
friends, and choose them here, instead of
up-town.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I glanced at the hammer that the Altruist’s
hands were clasping nervously. A
look of exultation crept into his eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I repair the doorstep,” he said.
“That I do not do up-town. But somebody
has to do it here. I am willing to
do anything that will convince my friends
here of my desire for good-fellowship.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The pathos of this unasked service
touched me. It was full of the everlasting
irony of zeal; the queer achievement
mocked the great design.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“But do you not feel a little at a loss,”
I asked, “as to what to do next?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does one feel at a loss in De Ruyter
or in Endicott Square?” demanded the
Altruist, defiantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have come down here because I have
seen great misery,—misery of poverty, misery
of sin. I have cast in my lot with the
victims of our civilization. The awful condition
of these people is the result not only
of their transgression of the laws of God,
but also of our transgression of the law of
Christ. Our whole social and industrial
systems are built up on the law of competition,
the law of beasts, by which the
greedier and stronger snatch the portion
of the weak.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Altruist had clasped his hands over
the end of the upright hammer, and was
leaning his chin against them. His voice
had taken a high key, and it sounded as if
it came from a long way off.</p>

<p class='c010'>“These people are weak, and are trodden
under foot. They are trodden under our
feet, and their blood is on our garments.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>He spoke solemnly, and his eyes
gleamed with the look of inspiration that
the world’s fanatics share with the world’s
saints.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But,” I stammered, with a half-guilty
feeling, “your being here does not bring
these people bread.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It does not,” said the Altruist, “but it
brings a little beauty into their lives. I
share the work of the residents at Barnet
House. We have clubs of all kinds. We
have musicales and art exhibitions. There
is much that is definite in our effort.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Looking up, I caught sight of some
Burne-Jones pictures on the roughly-plastered
walls of the study.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Isn’t it like trying to feed a hungry
lion with rose-leaves?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Altruist’s face lighted up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is not what we do that is important,”
he said. “We stand for an eternal truth.
Barnet House and my study here are
only symbols of our faith. They have
inestimable value, not in our petty achievement,
but as a declaration of the right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>of our fellow-man to our sympathy and
love.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I listened with interest as my host proceeded
to set forth his criticism of society
and to unfold his plans for its reform. He
talked brilliantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>The race fell short of its grandest possibilities,
he said, in losing its hold on abstract
truths. Devotion to an ideal was
forgotten in the adjustment of human
lives to one another, rather than to something
above and beyond them. In attempting
to solve minor concrete problems,
society had dissipated all energy for lofty
thought.</p>

<p class='c010'>In confiding to me his ideas for reconstruction
the Altruist talked of human life
as if it were something in which he did not
share; as if he stood apart from its real
issues, apart, and higher than his fellows,
to whom he reached down a helping hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>His conversation enabled me to understand
his face. It was full of a fierce enthusiasm,
which life had not yet tamed.</p>

<p class='c010'>I found myself saying: “But your life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>is ascetic. In your devotion to an idea
you sacrifice too much; you are like
monks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not at all,” he maintained. “We
take no vow. Our life is wonderfully
broad and free. Instead of being bound
by mere individual experience we share
the lives of all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I wondered that I had not thought of
this before.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The usual existence of married people,”
he said deliberately, “with its narrow, selfish
interests, seems to me, especially in
the case of women, largely animal. They
cannot know the higher joys of service to
one’s kind.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was strange to hear these opinions
coming from the rounded, childlike lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is no reason,” he went on,
“why families should not come down here
to share their lives with the poor. That
would be in some ways a better solution of
the problem than Barnet House, or my solitary
effort. Surely it is the duty of the
cultured, to whom much has been given,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>to share of their abundance with those who
starve.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But the children,—” I suggested. “It
would not be possible to bring up children
in such associations.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I sometimes think,” said the Altruist,
“that a further sacrifice is necessary in
order to wipe out the sins of our forefathers.
Perhaps, in order to be free for
this great work, it is the duty of the race
to abstain for a generation from bringing
children into the world,—for a generation
or two,” he added dreamily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That,” I assented mentally, as I rose
to go, “would certainly be effectual.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Man of the World (I shall introduce
my friends in the order in which I
met them; it is not artistic, but neither is
life)—the Man of the World was fourteen
years old.</p>

<p class='c010'>I made his acquaintance in this wise.</p>

<p class='c010'>One night I went down early to dinner.
As I waited in the parlour for the bell to
ring, a portière was drawn, and there
entered what I supposed to be a little boy.
He was so short, chubby, and round-faced
that at first sight he looked younger than
he was. I bent over, saying graciously as
I held out my hand,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder if you will tell me your
name?”</p>

<p class='c010'>When he looked up I realized what I
had done. Evidently a mistaken world was
in the habit of confusing smallness of stature
with lack of experience.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“I beg your pardon?” was all he said,
but the touch of dignity in the childish
petulance of his tone rebuked me. That
was the last time I ever patronized Morey
Steiner.</p>

<p class='c010'>The chill in the atmosphere was not dispelled
even when he was formally presented
to me by our hostess.</p>

<p class='c010'>At dinner the Man of the World and
I sat side by side. It was not until I asked
him if he cared for Jefferson’s Rip Van
Winkle that my disgrace was retrieved.
Dramatic criticism was the child’s strong
point,—one of his strong points.</p>

<p class='c010'>He told me that he thought Rip Van
Winkle rather amusing. Then he asked
me if I did not consider the knife-whetting
business in Irving’s Shylock rather stagey.
The part that he cared for most of all was
Mr. Mansfield’s Beau Brummell.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, he went to the theatre a great deal,
sometimes with his father or his sisters,
sometimes alone. That was his father,
those were his sisters. His mother was
dead. The family had just come to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>city, and they were going to stay at this
place until they found a house to live in.</p>

<p class='c010'>I saw that his father represented money,
and, looking down at the worldly-wise
scrap of a lad at my side, I realized what
wealth and American civilization can do
for the very young.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did I play cards?” he asked suddenly.
“No? Perhaps his brother would teach
me when he came. His brother played
well.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The end of the dinner interrupted our
discussion of horses. It also interrupted
the Man of the World in the act of storing
away nuts and candies in his pocket. He
was glad I liked riding.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps,” he said, drawing my chair
back for me (the Man of the World was
a perfect gentleman—at times) “we can
have a ride in the park together some
day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently I found myself watching him
as he conversed with my hostess’ daughter
in the parlour. The round face was heavy
when he was silent. When he talked, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>lit up with precocious intelligence. He
had a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasé</span></i> air, as of one who is permanently
weary of many things, and in his
blue eyes I saw gleams of the knowledge
of good and evil. The child was old,—as
old as the serpent in the garden.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was destined to much mortification
that night. My mistake was repeated with
emphasis by another boarder, an elderly
gentleman in black.</p>

<p class='c010'>He chucked the Man of the World under
the chin when the latter rose politely to
say, “Won’t you take my chair, sir?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, thank you, little boy,” said
the old gentleman, “and who might you
be?”</p>

<p class='c010'>We all suffered for a moment. Then
the child said,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I <em>might</em> be the Prince of Wales, but I
am Morey Steiner.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Something at last became real to me:
that was the misery of the poor. It
seemed sadder than anything else in the
world, except the misery of their benefactors.
I could hardly tell whether, in
this great tragedy of poverty, it was actor
or spectator who suffered most.</p>

<p class='c010'>I saw on the one side hunger, sin, ignorance,
and they weighed down upon me
like a nightmare. I became familiar with
the crowded quarters of the city, where the
population was nine hundred to the acre.
I knew the inside of great shops, where
women worked and starved on two dollars
a week.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the other side I saw brave attempts
to help, that were yet half futile. There
were charities, religious and secular; relief-giving
societies, working into the hands of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>general organizations; there were settlements
among the poor. But they all
fought against frightful odds. The lot of
many who were trying to help was to look
and suffer, impotently.</p>

<p class='c010'>A kind of morbid fascination drew me
continually to the foreign quarters. I
liked the picturesqueness of the crowded
streets, where women in gay head-dresses
chattered, holding their babies in their
arms. I liked the alley-ways lined with
old-clothes shops, and the corners where
Russians, Italians, Germans, Jews congregated,
talking, laughing, quarrelling.
The quaint children in old-world garments
interested me; and the aged, wrinkled
faces of men and women roused often a
feeling of remembrance, as if I had known
them somewhere, in book or picture.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most crowded district was near the
sea. A broad thoroughfare called Traffic
Street skirted the city at the water edge.
On the outer side were enormous warehouses
and dock-yards; on the inner, tall
tenements.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Looking between the great buildings,
I caught sudden glimpses of blue water,
with my old friends, the white sea-gulls,
floating overhead. And often, in coming
down rickety tenement-house steps, from
scenes that left me sick and faint, the
sight of tall masts of ships thrilled me
with their inevitable suggestion of freedom
and escape.</p>

<p class='c010'>I had begun to feel that the misery of
it was greater than I could bear. Then
suddenly the Lad appeared.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Lad was a great comfort to me.</p>

<p class='c010'>I had for several days been conscious of
the presence of a new-comer in the house.
He was a young Southerner, with fine dark
eyes, and extraordinary alertness of body.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was something in the stranger’s
face that pleased me. Perhaps it was his
resolute mouth and a certain air of high-mindedness.
Perhaps it was only the boyish
way in which his soft hair waved back
from his forehead.</p>

<p class='c010'>I called him “the Lad,” because he
looked so young by the side of the Man of
the World.</p>

<p class='c010'>One day as I was talking with my friend,
the Butterfly Hunter, I was startled by
being told that the Lad had done some
brilliant scientific work, and had already
made for himself a reputation.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“He is only a boy!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is a man of twenty-seven,” said the
Lad, who had come in unnoticed.</p>

<p class='c010'>After that we became acquainted rapidly.</p>

<p class='c010'>I had never seen anybody so keenly alive.
He was eager, restless, quivering with
vitality. There was a kind of ferocity in
his way of working; he was busy finishing
a book, with a name occupying two lines. I
do not yet know what it means. And he
walked every day for miles, coming home
hungry and tired.</p>

<p class='c010'>I found myself trying to classify him. I
had fallen into the habit of classifying
everybody. Was he more interested in
his own soul, I wondered, or in the oppression
of the working-man?</p>

<p class='c010'>My astonishment was very great to discover
that he rarely thought about his soul,
and that he was not trying to reform anything.</p>

<p class='c010'>This was partly because he was so busy.
His whole effort was centred in his work,
and everything else was crowded out.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I feel the strength of my youth upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>me,” he said one day, “but I have done so
little, and the days are so short.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Before I knew it I was taking long walks
with the Lad, by the bridges over the tidal
river north of the city, or eastward by the
shipping and the sea. We watched the
sailing of out-bound vessels, and the landing
of emigrants from returning ships.</p>

<p class='c010'>He told me about his father and his sister.
He talked, too, a great deal about his
work, insisted on talking about it, although
he knew that I could not understand him.</p>

<p class='c010'>I presently came to be a kind of maiden
aunt to him. I gave him advice on various
matters. I introduced him to Janet
and the Doctor and the Altruist, who all
regarded him as a new and interesting
specimen.</p>

<p class='c010'>The longer I knew him, the more he
cheered me. There was something in his
very presence that was like the coming of
the young west wind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what do you do it for? You can’t
help. You only harrow up your own feelings.”
It was Janet who spoke, perverse,
unhappy, winsome Janet, sitting in a tall,
old-fashioned chair at the side of her little
tea-table.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose that it is better,” I answered
slowly, “to have one’s feelings harrowed
up over other people than over one’s self.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s a very neat thrust,” said the
girl. “Thank you. Do you know what
the Doctor says about all this reform-scheming
and theorizing?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That it is all ‘shoveling-fog.’ That is
a ’longshore expression. Don’t you like
it?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>“Very much,” I said. “But doesn’t it
suit as well any kind of talking, even the
discussion of the ‘Is-life-worth-living’ question?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must have been doing some especially
good deed,” said Janet, leaning her
pretty head against the back of her chair
and looking at me through half-shut eyes.
“You are so disagreeable. There isn’t any
soil that philanthropy thrives in so well as
in the ruins of the social and domestic
virtues.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Child,” I said, “I did not mean to be
personal. Why don’t you stop thinking,
and try to find shoes and stockings for
some of my poor people?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Quick tears sprang into her shining eyes.</p>

poor have done that I should descend upon
them as a last affliction. First, dirt; then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>a financial crisis and no work; then hunger
and cold; and then I. It is like the
plagues in Egypt.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I leaned back in my chair, powerless.
It was becoming evident to me that no
one could solve Janet’s problems for
her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It would be cowardly,” she said. “Because
I am unhappy, should I try to work
off my ill-humour upon the poor?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They might like to look at you,” I
suggested.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was making tea, and she stopped,
holding a dainty cup in her right hand, to
look up at me. That face, whose expression
changed so often, baffled and fascinated
me. The mouth curved often into
cynical smiles, but the eyes were the eyes
of a dreamer. At times Janet seemed to
me a child. At times she bore the weary
expression of one who has fought many
battles and has won but few.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” she said. “I am one of the
people whose agnosticism absolves them
from all action. You know the type. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>find it difficult to get up in the morning
or to button our boots because we cannot
comprehend the infinite. Really, agnosticism
makes a very soft down cushion on
which to recline at one’s ease.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you sometimes get tired of
thrusting arrows into yourself?” I asked.
“It must be hard to be a St. Sebastian
where you have to be persecutor and martyr
too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Please don’t make epigrams,” said the
girl. “It is a sign of degeneracy. I am
sorry to see you beginning to show traces
of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought perhaps you would not
understand me if I did not try to speak
in epigrams,” I answered meekly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Janet rose from her chair and came over
to stand at my side, brushing back, with
kindly fingers, a lock of hair that had
escaped from under my bonnet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But to go back to the question of good
works,” she said. “It seems to me that
it is useless to try anything. Listen.
When I was twelve years old I wanted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>to do some work for the city charity organization.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They sent me to take two aprons to a
woman on Harrow Street. ‘It was quite
safe,’ they said. So I went down through
the dirty street into an inner court, and
began to climb the stairs. It was perfectly
dark; it was unutterably filthy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The woman, I found, lived in the garret,
and, after the last flight of stairs, I
had to climb a ladder to reach her. In
the loft at the top of the ladder I saw,—I
shall never forget it!—a woman diseased,
shrunken, helpless. Half her face was
withered and gone; she was cold, hungry,
dirty. Two miserable little girls were
crawling around her, crying.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I stood there stupefied, unable to
speak, unable to grasp all the horror before
me. I could do nothing for them. I only
stared, helplessly, and petted the little girls.
Then I gave that bed-ridden woman the
two gingham aprons and came away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That scene made an impression upon
me that I shall never lose. Since then,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>all the charity work I have heard of has
seemed as ironic as that. Such misery is
hopeless. Something deeper than human
misdeeds must be the cause. I cannot
help it; I cannot help believing that we
are the sport of the gods, who sit behind
the curtain and laugh at our hurt.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In the pause that followed, Janet went
to the window, forgetting to put down the
empty cup that she had taken from me.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly she turned to me, with her
chin raised in defiance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Moreover,” she said slowly, “I don’t
want to forget my own life entirely in the
lives of other people. I want it all, the
pleasure and the pain of it, the whole cup
down to the dregs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was nothing for me to say; I
rose to go.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you think of the Lad?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl’s face brightened. “He is interesting,”
she said. “He is so different.
It seems to me that he is the only one of
us who is really living. The rest of us
are merely talking about it.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Whether she went driving in royal state
under her white carriage robes, or watched
from the nursery window the people passing
below, or stood in her little night-dress
on her brass bed before being tucked in,
Jean was always adorable.</p>

<p class='c010'>One day I took the Lad to see her.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had already called at the house a
number of times, but Jean had never been
brought down to the parlour.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps he had never before been acquainted
with a little child. I saw him
watch every motion of her yellow head as
she sat on the floor, looking solemnly at
the people about her. Jean was a grave
baby.</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently she lifted her hand and very
earnestly pointed one tiny finger at the
Lad.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>I had seen her do this many times. It
was her usual way of expressing approval
of a new acquaintance. But the Lad had
never seen it, and to him it meant, “Thou
art the man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He begged to be allowed to take her up.
As he lifted her, his face flushed.</p>

<p class='c010'>I did not tell him that she clung to
him so closely, and refused so peremptorily
to go to any one else, partly because
his arms were so strong. Jean liked the
grasp of firm muscles. To the Lad it
seemed that her obstinacy was only love
for him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He would not go home. Sitting before
the open fire, he gazed at the child on his
knee, and ignored all my glances.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jean looked at him steadily for a long
time, her hazel eyes meeting his of darker
brown. Then she played with his watch-chain.
Presently she was induced to display
all her accomplishments. She pointed
to her feet when they were named, to her
eyes, her hair, and even, ‘by request,’ to her
tongue.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Sitting there and watching them in the
shadows of the firelight, I could not help
thinking how much alike they were.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jean played until she was sleepy; then
she yawned, and the Lad laughed to see
the tears come into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>By and by her head nodded; she was
almost asleep. Not content with her position,
she crawled up, as she did with her
father, and put her head down in the Lad’s
neck, then went to sleep with one helpless
hand hanging over his shoulder, the other
softly patting him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lad started when she put down her
head; then he held her close.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was partly the way in which his arm
curled round her, and partly the light from
her fuzzy hair that made them look like the
Murillo picture of Saint Anthony and the
Christ-child.</p>

<p class='c010'>When I went over to take Jean away,
the Lad looked up, and I saw that his eyes
were moist with tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were faithful lovers after that.
Jean used to watch for him from the windows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>upstairs, and sometimes when she
saw him coming she would smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>He called often, always asking for her.
(This was partly because he did not dare ask
each time for Janet.) And the child was
carried downstairs with her arms stretched
out impatiently to meet him.</p>

<p class='c010'>One night he arrived when she was
asleep, but her mother sent for her. The
nurse came in softly, cradling the child in
her arms. Her yellow hair was wet and
curly about her face; below her white night-dress
hung one baby foot.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lad bent down and kissed it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>My fellow-philanthropists talked much
of the “Settlement Idea.” Its adherents
maintained that the world had not yet seen
any self-sacrifice so beautiful as this attempt
to share the lives of the poor by living
among them. On the other hand, members
of old, thoroughly organized, comfortable
societies for doing good pronounced
the new methods extremely vague.</p>

<p class='c010'>I wished to see for myself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before I had visited Barnet House, the
settlement of university men in Brand
Street, a similar house was opened by
young college women in the West End.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Altruist went with me to Barnet
House on Wednesday afternoon, when the
residents always had a musicale or a reading
for their friends in the neighbourhood.
As we drew near the house and saw the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>white curtains and green plants in the
window, shining out from among the dirt-begrimed
tenements, I said to myself (my
mood being severe) that it looked pretty,
but sentimental. I tried to remember who
had called this kind of effort to elevate the
slums “a philanthropic picnic in a wilderness
of sin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We were ushered by a tall young man
into a great sunshiny room that was full
of easy chairs and books and pictures.</p>

<p class='c010'>This was one of the residents, the Altruist
said in introducing him. He would
doubtless be kind enough to tell me what
I wished to know.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Settlement Idea is very simple,”
said the Resident, in answer to my questions.
He spoke with an air of dignity
that seemed too old for him. “A number
of people who wish to help the poor find a
house, put it into good sanitary condition,
and go to live there together, doing some
independent work, and some work in
common.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But what kind of work?” I asked.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“Pardon me,—I can understand why you
come, but not what you do when you get
here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Resident apparently did not notice
the touch of discourtesy in my remark.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Settlement,” he said, looking hesitatingly
toward the Altruist, “serves two
purposes. It is a station for philanthropic
work, and also a centre for social investigation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is social investigation?” I asked
bluntly.</p>

<p class='c010'>To my delight the young man laughed.
“That is a quotation from an article I am
writing. It sounds rather bookish, doesn’t
it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a very good sentence,—for an
article,” I admitted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, you see,” said the Resident,
his eyes twinkling, “social investigation
means drains and foods and that kind of
thing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes?” I said inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And immorality and crime and amusements.
Also wages and causes of popular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>discontent. In fact, it embraces almost
everything.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The mingled audacity and shyness of
the boy’s manner were very winning. I
was becoming interested, but the Altruist
looked deeply pained by this lightness of
tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How is this work carried on?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By visits,” said the Resident briefly,
“and statistics.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You go out from here to make the
visits upon the poor—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And then we make the statistics,” he
interrupted, “and publish them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly he became grave, and in doing
so made himself seem ten years older.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You look sceptical,” he said. “I am
myself, sometimes. But, seriously, I think
that this thing is worth doing. We come
because we are really interested in these
people. We are interested in all kinds of
ways. One man here is doing regular
missionary work. Another is writing a
book about the reasons for unsanitary living
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>in the slums, and is investigating the
condition of every tenement in the East
End. There’s a literary man here, looking
for material. He goes around getting local
colour, but he helps, too, and isn’t so useless
as he might seem to be.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Helps in what?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the collective work done by the
House,” said the Resident. “We have all
kinds of clubs,—literary, political, and
scientific. You see, though each man is
doing his own private work, we have organized
effort. It isn’t all exploration. However,
I believe I made our twofold object
clear in that opening sentence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then there are art exhibitions and lectures.
We invite our neighbours to come
to hear music, and to come to take baths.
We charge five cents for the baths. The
music is free. We have dinner parties
too, and receptions. You ought to see
the costumes that the East End can turn
out. A Brand Street swell in his evening
dress is a sight for gods and men.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t see what you talk about,” I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>said. “Your guests must be hard to
entertain.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, we talk about dime museums and
Tammany and the things that happen in
the streets. That’s when we are adapting
ourselves to our guests. Then we show
them pictures, and talk about high art and
literature. That’s when we are adapting
our guests to us. It’s immensely elevating
for them, immensely, just to talk with
us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I found that my objections to the Settlement
Idea were vanishing rapidly before
this young man’s sense of humour.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It really doesn’t do the people down
here a great deal of harm,” he was saying,
“and it does us a great deal of good.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is your interest in the practical or in
the theoretical side of the work?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the latter. I am a student of economics,
and have just taken my Ph.D.
degree. Lately,” he added, flushing, “I
have become a Socialist.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Altruist looked pleased.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The state of things down here has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>convinced me that an entire reconstruction
of our whole industrial system is the only
thing that can help the poor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I asked him if the misery of the poor
had not been much exaggerated in the
sensational reform journals.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It could not be exaggerated,” he said
vehemently. “No, the half has not been
told.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As he recounted tale after tale of the
sin and suffering caused by unrighteous
laws of trade, I sat numb with that sense of
personal hurt that one feels on first knowing
that these things are true.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Resident stopped, for the bell
rang, and a “neighbour” entered.</p>

<p class='c010'>The other residents came in; several
more guests arrived, and the Altruist,
who had been unusually silent for the last
fifteen minutes, became the centre of a
group of listeners.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the callers was a Salvation
Army captain, whose regiment was passing
through the city. One was a street-car
driver. He had half an hour off, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>had come to ask the time of a lecture to be
given that night. Mrs. Milligan, the washerwoman
who lived next door, ran in with
her youngest boy. Then came a lady from
Endicott Square, in a superb Parisian gown.</p>

<p class='c010'>We conversed most amicably in the intervals
of the music. When this was over,
a domestic appeared with a tray, and the
literary man made tea.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before I left I had a few more words
with the young Socialist.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s no use talking,” he said earnestly.
“However little direct practical
good we do, there is no doubt that our opportunity
is great for investigating. It is
obviously better to study the working of
economic laws in society itself than in
books. I am trying to get acquainted
with the working-people, and look at
their grievances from their point of view.
Socialism has been treated entirely too
much from the standpoint of the scholar
and the fanatic. I want to work in a more
practical way, getting at the new political
economy in the making.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>I came away quite willing to allow any
number of young men with Ph.D. degrees,
and honest enthusiasm, and a saving sense
of fun, to live in the slums.</p>

<p class='c010'>But I did not admit this to the Altruist.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>After a first visit to the settlement of
young women in the West End I found myself
going there very often. The gracious
friendliness with which I was met attracted
me strongly, and I became more and more
interested in the social experiment.</p>

<p class='c010'>This new house was not in the slums.
It stood in one of the old city squares,
whose aristocratic inhabitants had long
ago drifted away, leaving empty rooms for
the families of mechanics and poorly paid
clerks.</p>

<p class='c010'>Life here was gray and monotonous.
Into it my young girl friends had rushed,
with little knowledge of its actual conditions,
but with a firm determination to
change them for the better. This kind
of poverty did not mean starvation, they
said, but something worse: dearth of culture,
of beauty, of ideas.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>They were all political economists of
the school of Ruskin.</p>

<p class='c010'>The residents numbered ten. Some of
them were girls fresh from college; others
were women who bore marks of years of
brain-work. At their head was a slender,
dignified lady, who, after ten years of academic
life, had resigned a college professorship
in the classics for the sake of closer
contact with humanity.</p>

<p class='c010'>All phases of the activity in the house
soon became familiar to me.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sometimes I found the doors stormed
by crowds of eager children, waiting the
moment when the ladies should permit
them to enter, that they might deposit
pennies in the bank, or take books from
the library.</p>

<p class='c010'>Once I watched a Mothers’ Meeting
conducted by a fair-haired girl of twenty-two.</p>

<p class='c010'>I visited the boys’ clubs, and realized
that the rough lads were learning courtesy,
and much besides.</p>

<p class='c010'>Certain evenings were purely social.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Then we conversed, or listened to music,
or read stories aloud. On these occasions
I learned many useful things from the
“neighbours,” about house-keeping, and
the bringing up of children, and even
about politics.</p>

<p class='c010'>One shabby little woman, whose husband
had marched away with an industrial
delegation to present a petition to Congress,
told me that a terrible revolution
was coming in which the working-man
would at last gain his rights by means of
powder and shot.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would be hard to tell all the ways in
which these young collegians “drew nearer
the People”: through medicines given out
by the resident physician in the dispensary
downstairs; through presentations of Mrs.
Jarley’s wax-works, and of scenes from
eighteenth century comedy; through the
lending of cook-books and of treatises on
philosophy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Once I even saw a resident taking care
of a neighbour’s baby while the mother
went shopping. The young philanthropist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>told me, however, the next time I
saw her, that she had resolved not to
dissipate her energy in that way.</p>

<p class='c010'>But nothing else edified me so much as
the evening discussions on problems of the
day. The young women were even more
eager than the men at Barnet House to
walk in step with great popular movements.
Some of them were fairly well equipped for
practical economic study. Others were
collecting statistics with the most engaging
ignorance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Every week, a club devoted to the study
of social science, the “William Morris
League,” met at the Settlement. On these
evenings the head of the House sat, Lady
Abbess fashion, with nun and novice at
her side.</p>

<p class='c010'>And men and women from various trades-unions,
cigar-makers, street-car drivers, cotton-spinners,
garment-workers, a motley
group, listened to a paper on (perhaps):
“How to form Protective Unions among
Under-Paid Women.”</p>

<p class='c010'>For the deliverance of the working-woman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>was the hope that lay nearest the
Settlement’s heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>I always went away from these discussions
with feelings of mingled pride and
amusement. These were strong and earnest
young women, inspired by no wish for
notoriety, but eager to help and to understand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet it was a queer world, where the
maidens formed trades-unions, and young
men were making tea!</p>

<p class='c010'>It was very good tea.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The only serene face among us was that
of the Butterfly Hunter. The eyes of the
Altruist were clouded by the wrath of denunciation;
the Lad’s were full of unfulfilled
desire; and my own, I knew, were
troubled: they had been for so long a
time a mirror for pictures of sorrow. Into
Janet’s face crept more and more often
the puzzled expression of those who mistake
their own bad moods for philosophic
thought.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Hunter of Butterflies wore a look
of peace.</p>

<p class='c010'>I mistook this at first for the peace
of attainment. It was not that: he was
still pursuing—pursuing his butterfly.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was, they told me, a noted entomologist.
Many years ago he had discovered a
very rare butterfly, the <em>Erebia winifredæ</em>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>He had classified and named it, but had
never been able to follow its entire history.
With the scientist’s fine sense of the importance
of the least details he was still
studying it.</p>

<p class='c010'>This winter he had come to the city in
order to work with a member of the faculty
in the university. They were attempting to
raise the insect under artificial conditions,
and were carefully watching its growth.</p>

<p class='c010'>The difficulty of observing it in its home
is very great, for it can be found only during
certain portions of the year, and at
great altitudes. It lives in the Himalaya
Mountains, and in the Caucasus, just below
the snow-line, in the bleak regions of rock
and sedge.</p>

<p class='c010'>I heard the story of its discovery. Years
ago, when the scientist was young, he had
gone with an exploring party through
India to the southern side of the Himalayas.
On one long walk he lost his way,
and found himself at the bottom of a deep
gully, whose walls were apparently too
steep to climb. He was alone.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>There was nothing to do except to scale
the cliff. It was a perilous journey. After
hours of painful struggle the young man
reached the top, in a state of utter exhaustion.
By a last effort he drew himself up
over the edge of the precipice, and lay fainting
for a time, prostrate on the rock.</p>

<p class='c010'>When he woke, he found under his outstretched
hand a little dark butterfly, with
gold dust on its wings. It was his butterfly,
and it made his name famous.</p>

<p class='c010'>Every summer since that time he had
climbed to the limit of vegetation, and had
camped there on desolate mountain sides
for weeks, watching the butterfly’s growth.
He knew where and how it laid its eggs.
He knew on what it fed. He had watched
it change from grub to winged creature,
and yet it baffled him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He could not find out the length of its
life. The seasons of warmth at the altitude
of its home were short, and a part of
its existence was passed in seasons when
he could not study it.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had brought home a collection of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>specimens with which to experiment. A
room upstairs was devoted to them. Several
times I was invited to enter.</p>

<p class='c010'>I liked to watch the Butterfly Hunter as
he bent his gray head over the cocoons.
He was a tall man, and slender and lithe
as a boy, from much walking.</p>

<p class='c010'>That kindly, weather-beaten face puzzled
me. I could not tell whether or no traces
of passionate human experience lay hidden
under the look of absorbing interest in the
specimens he held in his hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>He would bend over the little gray winding-sheets,
touch one with his finger, reverently,
then look on in silence.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>His</em> butterfly!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Lad did not tell me how deeply he
was interested in Janet. He simply talked
about her a large part of the time when
he was with me. At first it had been the
book that filled his thought; now it was
Janet and the book.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps he did not know how far he was
taking me into his confidence. Perhaps he
did not care.</p>

<p class='c010'>Janet puzzled him. “I don’t understand,”
he said one day when we were
taking one of our long walks. “She
seems to be an absolute pessimist, and
yet she takes a strong interest in some
things.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For instance?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, in gowns.” He spoke unwillingly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She would not have any right to be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>pessimist about her gowns,” I said. “They
are too pretty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here the Lad shot past me with his
long stride. He had a way of forgetting
me for a minute, and of walking swiftly
ahead. He always turned and came back
to apologize, and yet I objected decidedly
to this phase of his absent-mindedness.
It was hardly deferential, I thought, to a
person of my years.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You walk,” I said, when he paused to
beg my pardon, “as if you had air in your
bones. You must be related to the birds.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was thinking,” he said, “and I forgot.
I was thinking how strange it is to find
women facing the newer criticism and making
up their minds on religious matters.
In the South they do not do it. They are
all orthodox. It goes with being a woman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Partly because it is expected of them.
Most of the men I know want their wives
to take the beaten paths, no matter how
far they themselves have strayed from
them. Marriage of that kind doesn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>seem marriage to me. I want my wife—if
I ever have one—to share all of my
life, the intellectual part of it as well as
the rest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s one thing I like about your
friend,” he continued, apparently unconscious
of the connection of ideas. There
was a great deal of the scholar’s <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i>
about the Lad. “She is so broad-minded.
She looks at things as fairly and impersonally
as a man does.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I changed the subject abruptly, for I
perceived that the Lad was going to say
more than he meant to about Janet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How did you reach your present position?”
I asked, for lack of something better.
“You are an agnostic, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In religious matters, yes,” he answered.
“And the reason is, that after I had been
trained in methods of scientific thought,
dogmatic thought became impossible. All
the theology I know anything about is
founded on arbitrary dogma.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To an outsider,” I said slowly, “science
seems at times dogmatic. Are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>its sceptical conclusions out of proportion
to its actual achievement? You scientists
deny beyond your power to prove. Kingsley
convicted you once for all in the argument
about the water-babies, and he did it
by your own methods. You have ‘no right
to say that God does not exist until you
have seen him not-existing.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Lad thought I was trifling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are mistaken,” he maintained.
“Genuine science neither asserts nor denies
where it cannot prove. It is silent
about the ideas of God and of immortality,
because it cannot find any basis for scientific
reasoning. It is magnificent,—that
reverence that keeps it from making great
unprovable statements about things in general.
Oh, think of the patience with which
scientists study the least things, and the
self-control that keeps them from drawing
conclusions before they have reached them,
and the splendid faith with which they go
on working!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lad’s eyes glowed with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course, my present position is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>final,” he added. “I expect to go on. I
have tremendous faith in doubt.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are creative even in your doubting,”
I reflected.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course,” said the Lad. “Otherwise
there would not be the least use in
doubting.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I told him that I had never known disbelief
so eager and enthusiastic. Agnosticism,
as I had watched it, had weakened
the whole moral fibre. With Janet, for instance,
loss of faith in God had meant loss
of faith in herself and in everything else.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t understand that,” said the Lad.
“The feeling that the old ground is slipping
from under me makes me want to
gird up my loins and start to find new.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But there is a terrible amount of suffering
in the mental growth of the race,”
he continued, after a pause. “I can stand
the loss of the hope and comfort in the
old ideas, but I can’t stand the pain that
my changed belief gives my poor old
father. I could have kept still, but that
seemed hardly honest. So I tried to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>him understand, and he was very badly
cut up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And your mother?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had never talked about his mother.
He was silent for a minute. We were on
one of the great bridges over the river,
and we stopped to watch the spires, the
gray roofs, and the one gilded dome of
the city across the shining water.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother,” he said at last, taking off
his hat and standing bare-headed in the
cold November air, “my mother is where
she understands. She died when I was a
little fellow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Where she understands! I smiled, but
the smile brought tears to my eyes. They
all went back, these wise young people
who had outgrown the faith of their
fathers and mothers,—they all went back
to it in moments of supreme emotion, and
rested in it, like little children.</p>

<p class='c010'>Naturally, I did not point out to the
Lad his lack of logic. I knew that he
was going to speak again of Janet, and I
waited. Presently the remark came.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“Such splendid power, and all wasted!
That girl could do anything that she
wished to do. There is a kind of impotent
idealism in her that keeps her from
acting. She refuses to see the difference
between the absolute and the relative.
She can not, or she will not, see that if she
is to have the ideal in this world she must
work it out in the actual.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wait,” I said. “She is young. Now
she is only a question mark. But this
uncertainty is a phase of her development.
Something positive will grow out of the
mood of denial.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If something could only rouse her,”
said the Lad; he had forgotten that I was
there,—“could sting her into life. If
something could only make her <em>care</em>!”</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>“If they only had a little common sense,”
the Doctor grumbled, “there wouldn’t be
any dilemma.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Which?” I asked. “Your poor family
or the charities?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Both,” was the answer. “If the Ebsteins
had any common sense, they would
not be in this plight; and if the charities
had any, the family would have been helped
long ago. The rarest thing in the world
is common sense.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How did you find them?” I asked; I
always liked to ask this. The Doctor was
continually taking care of people in trouble,
and as continually trying to conceal the
fact. “It is simply for practice,” she always
said. “My visits among the poor
are only a kind of clinic. If it weren’t
for the interests of science, I’d never set
foot in the slums again.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“Did you ever find among them any of
the valuable abnormal cases you are looking
for?” I asked once.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” she answered, “but I might. I
am always expecting to.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How did you discover the Ebsteins?”
I asked. It was a new charity “case,” and
I took a professional interest in it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had a patient in Snow Street, in a
basement,—an old woman with rheumatism.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What interesting scientific discoveries
you must be making there,” I murmured.
“Chronic rheumatism is no doubt very
instructive.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Doctor looked severe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A woman came down from the second
floor, and said that there were some people
on the fifth that needed help. She asked
me if I came from the Charity Building,”
said the Doctor, in disgust. “I can stand
a great deal, but I cannot stand being
mistaken for a philanthropist.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You ought to be more on your guard,”
I suggested. “You really put yourself into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>positions where it is difficult to discriminate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I climbed the stairs to the very top of
the house, and knocked at the only door I
saw. ‘Herein!’ called somebody. Then
I found myself in a room full of children.
No, they are not Mrs. Ebstein’s. She
rents a little hole in the wall from the
woman, a German, who lives in this room.
The only passage to the inner apartment
is through the outer one.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They opened Mrs. Ebstein’s door, and
there sat two children—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How old,” I asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“About twenty. Oh, they are grown
up and married. They looked like Babes
in the Wood, but they are man and wife.
The woman is a little thing with her hair in
two braids down her back. The man was
sitting with his arms on the table. He had
been resting his head on his hands; he
looked up when I entered, and was dazed at
first, then embarrassed. He is a nice, honest
German boy who ought to be at home
in the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vaterland</span></i> with his grandmother.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“What did they come here for?” I interrupted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To starve,” said the Doctor. “America
is like a great almshouse with no endowment.
She opens her arms to the poor
of all nations, and says: ‘Come here and
die.’ Luckily we have room enough to
bury them all in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How did you begin to talk with them?”
I asked. “What is the best way of beginning?
Do you suppose these people resent
being intruded upon as we should?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I simply held out my hand,” answered
the Doctor, and said: ‘Is this Mrs. Ebstein?’
I spoke in German. The little
woman burst out crying. She had been
crying before. Then I said: ‘Somebody
told me that you are in trouble. What
can I do for you?’ She only pulled her
husband’s sleeve and said: ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heinrich,
Heinrich! Komm mal, sprich!</span>’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I found out that they are German
Jews, ‘aus Berlin.’ They came here more
than a year ago, just after their marriage.
The man is a brass-finisher. He had a job
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>when he first came, and worked for six
months, I believe. Then the work shut
down. Since then they have lived on little
or nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They have really almost starved. I
glanced at a roll lying on the table, and
one of them told me that for weeks they
have lived on bread. Their landlady is
too poor to help them. They have both
tried to get work of any kind, and have
failed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘They said we could make gran’ fortune
in America,’ said Mrs. Ebstein. ‘Look!
this is my fortune!’ and she took two pennies
out of her apron-pocket and shook
them. ‘We eat these! After that we
starve!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“She is a vivacious little thing. When
she talked she was inimitable. Her eyes—she
has bright brown eyes—twinkled,
and she forgot that she was hungry. She
was telling me about her experiences in
trying to get work.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Give me their address,” I said, “and I
will report them to the Good Samaritans.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“No,” said the Doctor, quietly, “I want
to take care of them myself. Will you
help?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly,” I answered. “They are
very interesting. Only you should have
found them in a garret. Something is
lacking in your background. It isn’t
artistic.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There was altogether too much background,”
said the Doctor. “Nearly all
the inhabitants of the tenement-house
swarmed up while I was there, and all
of the landlady’s children came as far
into that tiny room as was possible. No,
the lonely garret exists only in story-books.
Its seclusion is too good to be true. The
worst feature in the lives of the poor is
that they have to be born and to die in
public.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now that I think of it,” added the
Doctor, rising and looking at her list of calls,
“do you think that you could get a baby’s
wardrobe together for Mrs. Ebstein?”</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'>“Into our hands hath it been given to settle the course
of the world.”—<em>Shah Nameh</em>, <span class='sc'>Firdausi</span>.</p>

<p class='c009'>We were a committee—the Doctor,
Janet, the Altruist, and I—to consider
what could be done for the women and
girls in Brand Street. The Altruist wished
us to undertake some work in connection
with Barnet House.</p>

<p class='c010'>We sat round the table in the parlour of
my boarding-house. The cloth had been
removed. A block of paper and a pencil
lay in front of each of us, ready for taking
notes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I like the way we have,” said Janet,
who looked the incarnation of the spirit
of mischief, “of trying to teach other
people how to live because we do not
know how ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You and I have not erred very deeply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>in that way, Janet,” said the Doctor, drily.
“You must not accuse yourself where you
do not deserve it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Altruist looked impatient. “We
want to consider,” he said, “how we can
help our friends in Brand Street. We
must begin at once. I have an appointment
at four.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Another lecture?” asked Janet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” answered the Altruist, wearily.
“I get invitations almost every day to
lecture on life in the slums.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Paul,” said Janet, solemnly, though her
eyes were dancing, “you will be talking in
the park next on Sunday afternoons, and
we will all come and stand with the crowd
to listen to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps I shall,” said the Altruist. “If
it is necessary to convince the working-man
of my sympathy, I shall be glad to do it. I
should like to see my up-town friends standing
side by side with my neighbours from
the slums. Only,” he added thoughtfully,
“I doubt if my voice could carry. I have
said definitely that I will not speak to more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>than three thousand people. And in the
open air—”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then we opened the discussion. Janet
suggested that we begin with private theatricals
for the poor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They need to have their minds taken
off their troubles,” she said. “We cannot
really better their condition. Perhaps we
can divert their attention.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Altruist withheld his opinion of this
idea. He did not wish to discourage Janet.
It was partly in order to give her a practical
interest that he had started the work.
But an expression came into his face that
made Janet whisper,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“It really is not polite, Paul, to look
bored when other people are talking.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We want to accomplish something that
will be of permanent service,” he began.
“Mere temporary distraction will not do.
I thought that you three women would
know how to bring them something of
the graciousness and sweetness of your
own lives.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How can we effect anything whatever,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>asked the Doctor, “while those women live
under the conditions in which they must
live? They cannot even keep clean. It
is absolutely impossible. Cleanliness is
the most expensive luxury in the world.
What beauty and graciousness can be
brought into their lives so long as they
cannot take baths?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We cannot correct at once,” the Altruist
answered, “all the evil consequences
of our present system. But we can bring
these people into touch with higher spiritual
ideals—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We can form clubs,” I hastened to say,
wishing to appease the Doctor by means
of a practical suggestion. “We can teach
the women to sew, or we can have a literary
club and teach them how to read.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Altruist’s face brightened.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” he said, “these cruder methods
open the way. When our neighbours understand
that we want to meet them on the
common ground of human brotherhood,
that we ignore all class distinctions—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you think,” asked the Doctor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>eyeing the Altruist sharply, “that you
create class distinctions in order to wipe
them out? I thought that the idea of any
class distinction ran counter to the principles
of American democracy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is impossible to ignore the fact that
the distinctions do exist,” answered the
Altruist. “The lines of caste are just as
exclusive here as in Europe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And are you willing to forget them,
and to tell those people that you meet them
on terms of absolute equality? I think
that you will do it,” smiled the Doctor,
“just as long as you are not taken at
your word.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was something about the Altruist
that made him superior to petty annoyance
of this kind. He was not angry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We can convince them of our sympathy,
we can share with them our faith
and our aspiration,” he said gently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My faith and aspiration would be a
great support to them,” murmured Janet,
her lip curling in self-scorn. “No, cousin
Paul, just at present the relations between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Providence and me are a little strained, and
the greatest service I can do the world is
to hold my peace. There is no command
to go into all the world and preach the
interrogation point.”</p>

<p class='c010'>After beating the air for this length of
time we began to work, and in ten minutes
had formed a plan for a woman’s club. It
was to meet every week at Barnet House.
It was to be a literary club, carried on by
reading and by lectures. Once a week
there was to be a social evening.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We must have a party at least as often
as that,” pleaded the Altruist. “Our parties
are a great success. The neighbours
do so delight in lemonade.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In short,” said Janet, “we will elevate
the masses by Swinburne and <em>frappee</em>!”</p>

<p class='c010'>We reproved her for her flippancy, and
proceeded to work out the details of our
plan.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I told the Man of the World the story
of a business failure in the East End.
The sufferers were two very tiny Italian
boys, joint proprietors of a fruit-stand.
An unexpected season of warm weather
had proved bad for bananas, and the firm
was insolvent.</p>

<p class='c010'>I was right in thinking that the Man of
the World would be interested in hearing
of this, and I described the situation to
him in much detail.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Man of the World and I had become
great friends, and he had taken me into
his confidence. I knew all about the
money that he made at cards. A set
of his brother’s friends had taught him to
play poker, and were in the habit of amusing
themselves by letting him win. I
knew too about the horse that he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>bought without his father’s knowledge.
He kept it in a stable near the park, and
rode it every afternoon.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have to work a bluff game to get
there,” he said one day, “but I get there
just the same.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He told me about his young lady acquaintances.
Evidently he had several
who admired him much. Two embroidered
pillows and an elaborate photograph case
were proudly displayed by him as trophies
of conquest. One day, however, he had a
bitter quarrel with his prettiest girl friend.
It was, I believe, about a bag of popcorn.
After that he was very satirical in regard
to the entire sex, and had no communications
with any member of it except myself.
“There are no women in it for me any
longer,” he said darkly.</p>

<p class='c010'>When I asked him if he would like to
hear the story of my latest “case,” he
responded that it would give him great
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he regarded me for a minute with
a judicial air.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“What is it you do with people, anyway?”
he asked. “I don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, a great many things—” I began.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder if you’re like my Sunday-school
teacher. She’s awful good, she is
really. She goes down to the Traffic Street
wharves and picks up drunken men and
converts ’em. Do you do that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” I answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, could you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” I admitted, “I do not think that
I could.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But in spite of the confession of inferiority
on my part, he paid close attention to
my tale.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How old did you say those kids are?”
he asked when I had finished.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Seven and nine,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They’re game ones, aren’t they?”
commented the Man of the World.</p>

<p class='c010'>He went over to the window and stood
there, thinking, for a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If they had any money, do you think
they could start up the business again?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“Probably.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Man of the World thrust his hand
into his pocket and drew out a roll of bills,
which he offered me, sheepishly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We had a game of poker last night,”
he said, “and I scooped in—I mean, I
won. Take it, will you, for the little beggars?
I don’t need it. I’m flush, and can
ante just as well as not.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Our second committee-meeting left us
spent and weary. In making our programme
we began to question the wisdom
of presenting to working-women the scepticism
and doubt and denial of modern English
literature. We wandered off into a
wilderness of abstract questions, and, as
usual, lost our way.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly the door opened, and the Lad
strode in.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I beg your pardon,” he said, retreating.</p>

<p class='c010'>We urged him to enter, saying that our
work was done.</p>

<p class='c010'>He brought with him the freshness of
the open air. A wave of cheerfulness
swept over us, and we remembered that
the sun was shining out of doors.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a glorious day,” observed the Lad.
“I have just come in.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“I must go out for a walk,” said the
Doctor, rising.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Altruist followed, and Janet would
have gone, but the Lad looked at her
entreatingly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, don’t go!” he begged, with no
perception of the fact that his remark was
embarrassing. “I have so many things to
say to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To my great surprise the girl smiled
and lingered. When Janet chose to be
gracious, she was very gracious indeed.</p>

<p class='c010'>I kindly took up my notes to make out
the minutes of the meeting, and my young
friends seated themselves by the window.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You all looked rather blue when I
came in,” remarked the Lad.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We were,” said Janet. “We had been
talking of the future of the human soul
as argued by Tennyson, and assumed by
Browning, and ignored by Swinburne. You
see, we can’t decide whether to teach the
lower classes doubt or conviction.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lad was too much in earnest to
notice the irony.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“I don’t see why you are all so troubled
about a life beyond this,” he said. “Immortality
isn’t the question, is it, while we
have this world on our hands?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is at least very human,” the girl
answered, “as we cannot conduct this life
properly, to ask for another and a larger
one to spoil.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But this one is so satisfactory!” cried
the Lad. “The mere delight in breathing
is enough, if we cannot have anything
else. I don’t feel the need of metaphysical
certainties so long as I can feel the
pulses beat, as they do beat in my wrists.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What if your physical joy in living
should change into physical pain?” asked
Janet, gravely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Suppose we talk of something else,”
suggested the Lad. “We never get anywhere
in discussing questions like this.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Except into corners in the argument,”
retorted Janet, smiling maliciously. “You
are in one now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I’m very happy there,” laughed
the Lad.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>That was only too evident.</p>

<p class='c010'>They stayed, talking eagerly of Heaven
knows what, until the sun went down. It
made a golden background for the profiles
outlined against the window-pane. Stray
locks of Janet’s hair were touched into
sombre brightness, and the colour in her
cheeks grew warm and red.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lad was gazing at her with softly
shining eyes.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>One Sunday afternoon I went to hear
the Altruist lecture on the book of Job.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had converted a Brand Street dance-hall
into an auditorium, and the popular
lectures he gave there drew many followers
to his feet. He spoke with equal
power on social, on religious, and on literary
themes. Young working-men flocked
round him to hear him set forth the wrongs
of our present system of government, and
the better things to be. Night after night
the hall was crowded by men and women
of all ranks and all occupations, who
watched with untiring interest his treatment
of positivism, agnosticism, atheism,
Schopenhauerism, and his triumphant exposition
of a belief that they are all recognized
and transcended in the creed of
the Anglican church.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>I can see him now, if I shut my eyes,—a
nervous little figure behind the low desk.
There was a curious glint in his eyes,
which were always looking over and beyond
the heads of his audience. I can see, too,
the eager, stricken faces of his hearers.
They drank in his teachings with consuming
thirst.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have heard him speak many times, but
I have rarely seen the eyes of one of his
listeners removed an instant from his face.
A kind of mesmeric power held them.
There were questionings and rebellious
objections before his arrival, or after his
departure, but never in his presence.</p>

<p class='c010'>I remember the comments made by two
young granite-cutters one night before his
lecture, Lecture X., in the “Exposition of
Contemporary Thought.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t for the life of me see,” said one
of them, “how he can believe all this ’ere
science and evolution and believe in Genesis
too. ’Spose he’ll answer if I ask him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Try,” said the other. “If he can’t
answer your question, he’ll turn it into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>something he can answer. He’ll talk, anyway.
And I’ll bet a dollar you won’t know
but what he’s talking about the thing you
asked him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But that very night the two young sceptics
were smitten down. The Altruist
pronounced their questions ignorant and
crude, and explained the apparent contradiction
in his beliefs as a part of the eternal
paradox at the heart of all things.</p>

<p class='c010'>I invited Janet to go with me on this
particular Sunday, but she refused.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think that I would rather not hear
Paul expound Job,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He will do it brilliantly,” I suggested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Too brilliantly,” she laughed. “He
talks so wisely of all human experience
that you suspect him of never having had
any of his own. He stands condemned
by the amount of wisdom that he can
utter concerning life which he has not
shared. You feel that it all came from
books.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But perhaps he will not deal with Job’s
emotional experiences. The lecture may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>purely abstract. Don’t you like to hear
your cousin philosophize?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” said the girl, “I don’t. Paul
finds the universe easy to explain, but I
mistrust his logic. To quote, I have forgotten
whom: ‘Corner him in an argument,
and he escapes out of the window
into the Infinite.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>So I went alone. Before the Altruist
had been speaking five minutes I regretted
that Janet had not come. He was
alluding to other great rebels of literature,—Dante,
Prometheus, and our own
Carlyle,—souls stung by hurt into war
with God, and afterward fighting their
way through to a bitter peace.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a hush. Then we heard Job
talking with God. His upbraiding of the
Creator thundered through the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>The impression given cannot be translated
into words. The audience was swayed
by the Altruist as grass is swayed by the
wind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Who had not known moments like that,
when one arraigned God for hiding his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>meanings from the eyes of men? That
time of negation was necessary, leading,
as it must, to affirmation. It was only a
season of darkness, breaking into clearest
light. Soon insight followed blindness;
conviction followed doubt. Uncertainty
could be only temporary with noble souls.
For them the fog cleared, and a universe
of order rose from chaos. They would
suffer no longer the clouding of the intellect,
or know the rebellion of the heart.
Their cry was answered, and reason grasped
the scheme of things.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of this sure knowledge, universal expression
had been given in the formulas
of Anglican belief.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the Altruist expounded the final relations
of Job to the Creator, and explained
God’s thought for man, the sudden illumination
was blinding. For a moment
the ultimate meaning of life and of death
seemed ours.</p>

<p class='c010'>The audience crowded round the Altruist
to utter words of gratitude. One or
two women wiped their eyes, and working-men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>of known sceptical tendencies came
forward, with a certain shame-facedness,
to grasp the Altruist’s hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>I walked home alone in the early winter
twilight.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no one in the parlour except
the Butterfly Hunter, who was sitting by a
western window, with a sheet of sketches
from his specimens lying on his knee.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was too dark to see clearly any longer.
The old scientist had forgotten his drawings,
and was watching one great star in
an orange patch of sky between two dark
lines of cloud.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is strange,” he said, half to himself,
half to me, as I seated myself in an easy
chair, “that truth, the least truth, is so
hard to find. We buy it dearly, and with
long effort, and then we do not understand
the whole of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He rose and brought his pictures to me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have been studying that little creature,”
he said, “for forty years, and yet I
know nothing of the beginning or of the
end of its life. It begins in mystery; it
ends in mystery.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I collected for Mrs. Ebstein a wardrobe
of tiny garments. Some of them
were Jean’s outgrown clothing. Some of
them I made myself, sitting alone in my
study in the early winter evenings.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was almost Christmas time when I
took them down to Snow Street. I too
climbed the long flights of stairs, and
passed through the noisy room where the
seven children lived.</p>

<p class='c010'>I found Mrs. Ebstein in her room alone.
When I opened my bag and gave her its
contents, her face shone. She grasped
both my hands and gave me a great kiss.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are so good toward me!” she
said in broken English. “You make so
much trouble for me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then she stroked the little socks. “Wie
niedlich! Wie reizend!”</p>

<p class='c010'>We talked for some time in bad English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>and worse German. When at last I rose
to go, Mrs. Ebstein took both my hands
again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did not know,” she said, “but you
are so good,—and I am ganz allein! No
sister, keine Mutter. Will you come mit
the doctor-lady when she comes?”</p>

<p class='c010'>And smiling to see into what strange
paths my endeavour to serve humanity was
leading me, I promised. She was so
young; she was so far away from home.</p>

<p class='c010'>Her child was born on the night of the
twenty-sixth of December. I went down
in the afternoon with the Doctor; and all
night long I waited and watched, in the
outer room, from which the seven children
had been banished.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Doctor and the district nurse cared
for the patient.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sitting out by the fire, I hung the little
flannel robes again and again in the warmest
place, saying over and over the lines
of the folk-song:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Mine ear is full of the murmur of rocking cradles.</div>
      <div class='line'>‘For a single cradle,’ saith Nature, ‘I would give every one of my graves.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>All night long I was hushed into awe
by the coming of new life, and hurt by a
pain that the presence of death does not
give.</p>

<p class='c010'>When it was almost morning, I heard a
cry, and the words of the folk-song changed
into the words of the Bible: “And so she
brought forth her first-born child.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We were high over the city. It was
just before dawn. In the east I caught
the first hint of the morning light, and
down below me I saw the roofs of the
city dimly outlined in the fading darkness.</p>

<p class='c010'>As I watched, the Doctor came out and
joined me, weary, but with a look upon
her face that I had never seen before.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never perform this service,” she said
slowly, “without feeling that I have been
doing a sacrificial act.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I did not speak.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No wonder,” said the Doctor, “that
the symbol of the world’s salvation has
been so long a mother with her baby in
her arms. It pictures the greatest glory
of all our human life.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>The light grew stronger in the east.
The Doctor’s eyes were strained toward it,
and her face was very beautiful.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose it is because it is so near
Christmas time that I think of this,” she
continued. “I wonder why we have always
tried to read a supernatural meaning into
the story of the Christ-child. ‘The Holy
Ghost shall come upon thee,—the power
of the Highest shall overshadow thee;
therefore the holy thing that shall be born
of thee’—I tell you,” said the Doctor,
interrupting herself energetically, “that
means only that the birth of human life
is always sacred. We might well say at
every birth: ‘Go and search—for the
young child—and bring me word—that
I may come and worship him.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>We watched the light grow strong and
clear over the quiet city. The grimy tenement
houses and the polluted streets became
more and more distinct. Then the
noise of rattling wheels and of hurrying
feet came faintly to our ears. The toil of
another day had begun.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>After a time the nurse came out of the
inner room, holding in her arms the newborn
child. It was wriggling in the garments
in which it had been wrapped. The
Doctor looked down at the little purple
face and screwed-up nose, and her expression
changed to one of professional disgust.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I haven’t a doubt,” she muttered, “that
it is a poor, miserable, rickety little vagabond.
Why must there be this terrible
increase of population among paupers?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>My colleagues did not share my discouragement
in regard to the East End. There
was much to hope for, they maintained,
from the spread of information concerning
it, from the awakening interest of the
upper classes in its condition, and from all
our new and intelligent methods of doing
good.</p>

<p class='c010'>This was true. Each board-meeting,
conference, committee-meeting to which I
went as guest or member, gave me fresh
proof of the growth of knowledge about
the destitute, while the practical activity of
individuals and of societies seemed full of
promise for the poor.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was one great Bureau of Inquiry
which existed solely for the purpose of
investigating new “cases.” Its agents, visiting
the needy, gleaned innumerable facts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>that were entered in the books under heads
like these: “Work, How Many? Bad
Habits, What? Ill? Rent? Pay? Can
Read? Can Write?”</p>

<p class='c010'>This vast body was constantly torn in
twain between a desire to find out genuine
suffering, and a fear of being deceived.</p>

<p class='c010'>Closely connected with this Bureau was
the Society of Good Samaritans, who represented,
not only the new knowledge
concerning the poor, but also improved
methods of relief. The Samaritans always
sat in lengthy conference on Friday night,
discussing in friendly fashion (not without
gossip) the domestic affairs of the family
in hand, and voting: “No Aid”; or, “Aid,
$2.00 in groceries, visitor please follow up”;
or, “Give Citizen’s Emergency Ticket for
snow-shovelling”; and again, “No Aid.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Another relief-giving society, the Almoners,
differed from the Good Samaritans
only in the greater carefulness of its
proceedings. All its action was well
considered and most deliberate. Its committee-meetings
were full of anxious discussion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>of the question, “What do we do
with such cases in District A?” and its
most innocent reports were headed “Confidential!”</p>

<p class='c010'>For instance:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Almoners request that the facts
given below be used, especially if unfavourable,
with great care.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In the case of</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Abruzzi, Federigo,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>No. 10 Mulberry Street.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Barber. Six children. No work. Gave
shoes and stockings.”</p>

<p class='c009'>These organizations were alike in the
business-like quality of their work, in the
wary kindliness with which they treated
the poor, and in their thirst for accurate
information. It occasionally happened that
representatives of all three societies met
by chance in the one room of a new
“case,” and gravely carried on their investigations
together.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps some of the questions that these
agents of organized philanthropy were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>authorized to ask passed the line where
friendly interest becomes impertinence.
However, they but voiced the popular
opinion, that “people of that sort” do not
mind intrusion. Of many this was doubtless
true, and a great corporation can
hardly be expected to engage in character-study.</p>

<p class='c010'>The intellectual curiosity evinced by
these bodies in matters of practical detail
was visible also in their theories of work.
New charity methods, English, German,
and Australian, were carefully discussed.
On our boards were men who were familiar
with all known schemes of in-door and outdoor
relief, and women who were masters
of statistics. We knew not only the best
ways of carrying on investigation, but also
the best ways of co-operating with the
Church, with the State, and with one
another.</p>

<p class='c010'>But here theorizing stopped. These
students of social disease did not seem to
doubt the essential soundness of the social
constitution. Criticism of the present industrial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>system and of the relation between
classes did not, apparently, occur to them.
The Altruist’s economic ideas would have
filled them with surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>My misgivings concerning all this work
did not come from the usual objections to
it, that the proceedings of huge bodies are
often too slow to be of use, because of the
time wasted in adjusting formalities, and
that the energy meant for action is dissipated
in argument. I was impressed only
by the hopelessness of finding out what to
do. After patient inquiry the gulf between
misery and the wish to help was nearly as
wide as before. Facts may be facts without
telling the truth, and with all our
knowledge we did not understand.</p>

<p class='c010'>This was not true of every member
of the associations. There were certain
women who possessed a gift of practical
kindness, and were philanthropists by divine
right. And surely the effectiveness
of an organized body means the effectiveness
of the individuals composing it.</p>

<p class='c010'>But different attitudes were represented.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Side by side with these women who were
quick to help and slow to condemn, were
others who allowed their respect for the
ten commandments of the Old Testament
to keep them from obeying the one command
of the New. They pronounced judgment
on the unfortunate with the most
impressive finality, as if wrong-doing were
doubly wrong in the East End. As I
listened to them I sometimes thought that
the ethical standard which the rich try to
preserve for the poor is very high.</p>

<p class='c010'>I liked to watch these charitable women,
and to wonder why they were doing this
work. Some, whose faces had been made
sweet by sorrow, were striving only to find
expression for sympathy with human pain.
Some, who looked eager, restless, dissatisfied,
were trying, I thought, to find in
the lives of others the absorbing interest
they had missed in their own. A few, I
feared, had espoused the cause of the
needy for the sake of social distinction.
An interest in the poor was one of
the really important things, like the cut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>of one’s sleeves, or one’s knowledge of
Buddha.</p>

<p class='c010'>I discovered a new species of benevolent
woman, unlike the old-fashioned Saint Elizabeth
who encouraged pauperism by indiscriminate
distribution of loaves. A call
that I made on a fellow-Almoner (for in
an interval when my Cause did not keep
me busy I had rashly joined this body)
made me hope that the old Lady Bountiful
armed with pity will never quite give
place to this new Lady Bountiful armed
with views.</p>

<p class='c010'>I had given my friend this name because
she looked so sympathetic. She
was a blithe little woman, very wealthy
and very charitable. On this occasion I
found her just going out. As she came
smiling to meet me, in her light cloth
gown with gloves and gaiters of the exact
shade, I thought how charming she was.</p>

<p class='c010'>My Lady Bountiful had principles. She
always performed her full social duty, and
she told me, before I introduced the subject
I had come to discuss, how tired she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>was. Dinners and receptions and the
theatre had tired her out. Yet she had
given up none of her charity work. Her
maid did all the necessary visiting for
her.</p>

<p class='c010'>When I set forth the object of my visit
she looked disapproving. I wanted to
change the policy of our Board, of which
she was a director, to meet the distress
caused by a sudden financial crisis. But
My Lady interrupted my description of
the misery of the unemployed in the East
End.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not believe in voting special relief
for these people,” she said. “Their suffering
will be a lesson to them. When
they have work they are improvident;
when it stops they starve. They must
learn thrift and economy, even if it has
to be taught them in this severe way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a strange situation,—Dives in
his purple and Lazarus in his rags again.
But Dives played a new rôle, no longer
standing aloof, but coming near enough
the gate to study Lazarus, and then intimating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>that his character was not all it
should be.</p>

<p class='c010'>My Lady went on to speak of work,
of how noble it is, and how little common
people appreciate its sacredness. I
watched with a certain feeling of curiosity
the dainty figure against the rich background
of the beautiful house. The
fingers that were emphasizing the panegyric
of work had never been guilty of
a half-hour’s honest toil.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” said my hostess, when I rose to
go, “this crisis means discipline for the
poor, and we must not interfere. I think
as you investigate further you will find
that poverty is always the result of idleness,
intemperance, or crime.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then this distress is retributive?” I
murmured. “It testifies to the negligence
of the poor, and indirectly to our own
industry, temperance, virtue?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” said My Lady, firmly. She was
always firm. “Don’t look so unhappy,”
she added, as she took my hand at parting.
“It isn’t such a bad world, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>all. I never can see why people insist
on crying out all sorts of unpleasant
things about it. I am a thorough optimist,
you see.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I reflected, after the cool air of the
street had soothed my irritation, that we
were all like that. Each one of us had
pronounced opinions, right or wrong. I
wondered if it would not be better for
the poor if we knew less about them and
cared more.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Through all my study of human misery,
the thought of my little romance flashed
like swift sunshine. Some of the sadness
faded out of Janet’s face, and every day, I
thought, the Lad’s lips were more firmly set
in his effort to win. I wondered what the
outcome would be. If his chin had not
been so square and so determined, I should
have doubted his victory.</p>

<p class='c010'>Janet joined us in our expeditions.
Then, as the weeks went on, the two
young Bohemians took long walks by
themselves, while I stayed at home or in
my office,—for my Cause had a downtown
office,—following them only with
my blessing.</p>

<p class='c010'>I had grown very fond of both. It was
well for them to be together. Janet was
waking up, as in a keen electric shock,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>under the influence of the Lad’s resistless
energy. “There is something contagious
in his vitality,” she said one day. “When
you are with him, you feel that you are
face to face with immortal youth, and can
never grow old.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In their long conversations they passed,
as was natural, from the abstract to the
personal. It was amusing to hear their
encounters of words. Every bitter remark
that the girl made was met and worsted by
the strong logic and the strong hopefulness
of her opponent.</p>

<p class='c010'>She heard from him the history of his
book. It was controversial. He was
waging a scientific battle with his dearest
friend, the author of an article that the
Lad said was “all off.” It had served as
the flinging of a gauntlet, and the Lad had
picked it up. The book was to be, he
said, not only a criticism of Rainforth, but
the first setting forth of his own theory,
and the Lad felt that his future welfare
depended on his triumph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not that I can come anywhere near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Rainforth generally,” he said. “He’s a
genius. Yes, he’s the only genius I have
ever known. I am simply a pigmy by the
side of him. But just here I know he is
wrong, and I intend to prove it. If I succeed,
nobody will congratulate me so
heartily as he.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As to me, he had talked of Janet and the
book, to her he talked of the book and
Rainforth. They had been like David and
Jonathan in college and ever since. In
argument they had fought many a glorious
field. Now Rainforth was winning honour
in the West, and the Lad was watching
every step of his career with intense pride.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You ought to see him,” cried the Lad.
“He fairly towers above all the people
near him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a touch of novelty in the situation.
That a hero-worshipper should invite
his hero to step down from the pedestal
and do battle with him seemed a dangerous
proceeding. Yet I knew that if the hero
came out second-best, the worship would
be no whit abated.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>I fancied that Janet grew weary of hearing
so much of Rainforth, but I was not
sure. She spoke less and less often of the
Lad. In place of the specific frankness
with which he talked of her, she generalized;
and because her “humorous melancholy”
was so little appreciated by him,
she spent it all on me.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was talking one day of the elusiveness
of life. We were always seeming to
catch a meaning in it, she said, first in one
place, then in another. In will-o’-the-wisp
fashion it danced through religion, through
philosophy, through aspiration of every
kind. We went from illusion to illusion,
from dream to dream. The gods (thus
Janet named the hostile powers whom she
sometimes imagined behind the scenes), in
order to amuse themselves, had made this
world as a great playground, where their
creatures, cobweb-blinded, played an endless
game of blindman’s buff. The last
and most cruel illusion of all was love.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was then that I knew that she had
begun to care for the Lad.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>In the early winter my work developed
so as to demand all my time. In consequence
of the business depression, the
suffering in the city had increased tenfold.
My experiences of the daytime
haunted me at night. In my dreams I
climbed the dark stairways of the poor,
and door after door opened in my sleep
upon scenes of misery that I could not
help.</p>

<p class='c010'>I had no time now to talk with my young
friends, but the sight of them comforted
me. I found myself looking at Janet
with the Lad’s eyes. I, too, in watching
her face, saw “a glory upon it, as upon
the face of one who feels a light round
his hair.”</p>

  </div>

<p class='c009'>As I look back I am amazed at the
amount of talking that we all did. The
memory of the winter is a mist of “words,
words, words.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Long discussions of spiritual questions
were new to me. I had come from a
world where one took God and one’s duty
for granted, and endeavoured to act. Here
we wavered so long over uncertainties in
belief that we had little energy left for
work, and we talked of conflicting causes
until the world was turned into a snarl of
tangled theories.</p>

<p class='c010'>In my bewilderment I found myself
asking if it were worth while to try to
understand.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>My pretty Janet was wasting her days
in attempting to find a satisfactory way of
thinking about life; while the Altruist,
who alone among us was content with his
knowledge of things seen and unseen, had
succeeded only, I sometimes thought, in
thrusting between himself and his fellow-man
a theory of how to treat him, and
between himself and God the shadow of
an explanation of Him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Could one, after all, take life as simply
as the Lad took it, waiving abstract inquiry
while one attended to the matter in
hand? It seemed as if he, a denier of all
knowledge of God, had come very near
to Him in that ceaseless, unquestioning
activity.</p>

<p class='c010'>I began to doubt even the value of our
ideas about the poor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their deep satisfaction in existing contrasted
strongly with our restless questioning
of the uses of existence. Perhaps we,
who were so filled with pity for the victims
of life, had been better for a share in its
suffering; for it might be that the wisdom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>denied to thought lay written only in
experience.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus I decided that an intellectual grasp
of things in general is impossible, then,
woman-like, turned and did a little reasoning
of my own.</p>

<p class='c010'>Were there not enough strong young
souls like the Lad’s to break through the
woven spells of theory and wake the world
from sleep?</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“—just to stir up stagnation, you
know, and rouse interest by telling people
how things really are; for it’s ignorance
that’s the matter, sheer ignorance,
and I’m convinced that if the rich can be
made to understand the condition of the
poor, they’ll take measures to better it, so
I’m trying to raise the standard of general
intelligence and bring the classes
together—”</p>

<p class='c010'>The sentence went on and on. I could
hardly remember when it had begun. The
Young Reformer, who was calling on me,
had asked me to co-operate, and I had
innocently asked in what.</p>

<p class='c010'>“—public opinion is what we want,”
he was saying, “and we are safe if we
can get the press on our side; for it’s the
press that really rules the country, and not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>the pulpit, and I say the thing is to get
the great popular organs on our side and
let them work with us instead of against
us, and they will if we only use tact; for
I’ve found that if you only use tact the
thing is done.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What special work are you attempting?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, everything,” said the Young
Reformer, cheerfully. “It doesn’t make
any difference. When I see an evil I
begin to call attention to it. You have
got to be busy if you are going to accomplish
anything.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And what would you like to have me
do?” I inquired, gazing at my guest with
undisguised curiosity.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was an indescribable air of aimless
activity about him. He sat, in a
somewhat vague and tentative way, on
the edge of his chair, holding on his knee
a bundle of newspapers and manuscript
that he had been too busy to put down.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, what’s your strong point?” he
demanded.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>I was staggered, but it made no difference.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now mine is the platform,” he continued
confidentially. “Yes, I’m at my
best on the platform. It took me a long
time to find it out. I tried business and
I tried the law, but I was always restless
and felt that I wasn’t in the right place.
Then I got interested in social questions,
and thought I’d give myself up to public
effort.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I wondered if this young man were one
of those who, finding the duties of citizen
difficult to perform, condemn society.</p>

<p class='c010'>I repeated my question.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, do anything you are interested
in. Just begin where you choose, and
I’ll try to help you. It doesn’t make
much difference.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here he smiled encouragingly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“May I ask in what way you learned
my name?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'>The slight reproof for his intrusion
passed unnoticed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I’ve heard everywhere in the city
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>about what you’re doing. I’m trying to
get acquainted with everybody who is
working for the general good, and I
thought that if you would co-operate with
me in some way it would be better than
for us to work alone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I was conscious of a momentary wish to
write a manual of etiquette for reformers,
but my guest looked so innocent that I
forgave him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My opportunities for influencing public
opinion are limited,” I said. “I doubt
if I can assist you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I am sure you can,” he answered,
cordially. “I want to undertake something
new here. I try to adapt my programme
to the needs of each city. In
Chicago I gave a course of lectures on
‘The Crying Evils of the Day.’ The
press co-operated, and we made an organized
attack on wrong of all kinds. I
couldn’t follow it up because I had to go
on to another place. That’s the trouble.
But as I said, the great thing is to rouse
interest. I know that here there’s a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>deal of study of social questions, and I
want to do something to encourage that.
I like to be in the crest of each wave of
progress. Just what are you doing now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I described for him some of the minor
workings of my Cause. The details were
dry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now that kind of practical thing
doesn’t appeal to me,” he said. “I know
it’s necessary, but there isn’t any emotion
in it. You can’t get hold of the popular
heart that way. There’s nothing like the
platform, not even the pulpit. Well, I’ll
tell you. I’m going to begin a series of
banquets at St. Mark’s Hotel to bring the
classes together. I’ll have one next week,
and I want you to come. I’ll invite some
up-town people and the leaders of various
movements to meet some of the lower
classes, the real People, you know, and
we’ll see what can be done.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s nothing like beginning and
just letting a thing get under way, and
then when it’s started you know better
what to do. Start a movement and you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>can turn it into almost anything you want
to. All you need is to get your forces
going.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I accepted, I fear from curiosity, the
invitation to meet the People, and my
caller took his departure. He stood irresolute
on the steps for a moment, as if
wondering in which of all possible directions
he would better go. I reflected that
in the battle with human nature to which
he stepped out so airily, he would at least
have the satisfaction of never knowing his
defeat.</p>

<p class='c010'>And I wondered who would deliver society
from its deliverers.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich selber bin Volk.</span>”—<span class='sc'>Heinrich Heine.</span></p>

<p class='c009'>The socialistic banquet was a success.
Various members of the upper classes were
present, and several representatives of the
People. The Young Reformer presided
with great ease.</p>

<p class='c010'>The repast was not formal. Neither
were the speeches afterward. We hastened
over the material part of the feast,
and our host dismissed the waiters abruptly
when the coffee had been served.</p>

<p class='c010'>As I looked around the table in the
centre of the great hotel dining-room, I
realized that we were a distinctly curious
collection of human beings. Each one of
us stood for a cause. Representatives of
Church and University were sitting side by
side with Socialist and Anarchist. Two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>residents from Barnet House and the
head of the Woman’s Settlement were
there. Opposite me sat a Single Tax
agitator. At my left was a Knight of
Labour. There were present also four
prominent Trades Unionists, a Temperance
woman, a White Ribbon woman,
and a Populist.</p>

<p class='c010'>Our eyes were all fixed upon the Young
Reformer as he rapped upon the table and
called upon my friend, the Resident at Barnet
House, to speak in behalf of Socialism.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Resident spoke with dignity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is,” he said, “an economic fact that
Socialism is inevitable. Whether we will
or no, it is coming as surely as the days
are moving on. It is equally true that it,
as a system, offers to the individual a justice
that no other form of government can
offer. Under the centralizing system of
Socialism, with land and the forces of production
in the collective ownership of the
People, and monopolies done away, will
come at last that granting of equal rights
to all that democracy has failed to realize.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>The speaker was enthusiastically applauded.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then the Altruist was called upon in
behalf of the Brotherhood of Man.</p>

<p class='c010'>An abstract of his remarks can give no
idea of their power. The Altruist alluded
to our new recognition in this century of
the close relationship between high and
low. He described certain attempts, both
secular and religious, that have been made
to recognize this relationship. Then he
set forth his hope for the future, when
government shall be spiritualized, and the
principles of the Christian religion shall
be worked into our laws.</p>

<p class='c010'>The address was eloquent, and the audience
was strongly moved.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Altruist ended with an appeal.
The cultured must return to the People,
and the People must realize that in doing
this the upper classes have no sense of
superiority, and are actuated by motives
of purest Christian love.</p>

<p class='c010'>Our host was leaning back in his chair,
and his face wore a happy smile.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>A Trades Unionist, in responding to the
two preceding orators, said that it did him
good all over to hear remarks like theirs.
They expressed his sentiments exactly.
If more folks felt that way, there wouldn’t
be all this trouble between labour and capital.
The working-people were going to
have their rights, and if these were not
given, they would fight for them. But
the working-man was quite willing to meet
the capitalist half way and settle things
peacefully if it could be done.</p>

<p class='c010'>The young Socialist smiled at this militant
formulation of the principle of brotherly
love, but the Altruist did not hear.
He rarely listened to what other people
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>I fell into a fit of abstraction and caught
only fragments of the two next speeches.
I knew, in a dim fashion, that the Populist
had the floor, and was insisting that the
one way to achieve universal good was
by adopting the platform of his political
party. I knew that the Temperance
woman, who was sweet-faced and young,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>rose to say sternly that we were all wrong.
Only by wakening the moral forces could
the race be saved. For a world given
over to passion there was no economic
salvation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Watching these burdened, anxious faces
in the brilliant electric light, I wondered
how I could have lived nine and thirty
years without knowing that this old earth,
which I loved, was so very bad. Three
months ago I had seen only here and
there a thistle or a bramble bush in its
fair fields. Now it looked to me all weeds
and tares, weeds and tares.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Professor was responding to
the toast: “The University and the
People.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is no gulf between the University
and the People,” he said in a
quick, emphatic voice. He had a perplexed
air, as if wondering why he had
come.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The University was founded by the
People, for the People. Its interests are
the interests of the People. In its hands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>lies one of the highest powers in a nation’s
life. Economic conditions, moral
forces, are naught without the intellectual
guidance that comes through the trained
minds of a country’s devoted servants,
her scholars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>These remarks were sufficiently noncommittal,
yet the Professor was troubled,
fearing that he had not said the right
thing.</p>

<p class='c010'>The word People ran like a refrain
through all these remarks, and it puzzled
me. The People, it would seem, had been
injured, and their wrongs were to be set
right. But who were the People, and who
had harmed them?</p>

<p class='c010'>We pronounced ourselves ready to waive
all differences between ourselves and the
People. Who had suggested the differences?
Surely not the People. Even
now the voice of a clergyman was in
my ears, adjuring us all, indiscriminately,
to get nearer the People. I, who was
conscious that I belonged to the People
and had never gone away, was puzzled,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>feeling a certain lack of programme in
the suggestion.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last the Anarchist arose. I had
heard of him before, but had not seen
him. His quoted opinions had made my
blood run cold. Now I gazed at him in
surprise, for he did not at all resemble
the picture of him that my fancy had
made. Standing with his large old hands
folded, and his long gray beard rippling
over his bosom, he looked like an
aged apostle who was near the beatific
vision.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Friends,” he said, and his voice was
like the sound of a benediction, “I’ve
heerd all you’ve said about injestice and
wrong. You hain’t said half enough.
Nobody could say half enough about how
bad things be. But you ain’t got the right
remedy. Talkin’ won’t do it. We’ve got
to act. Friends, we’re workin’ towards
peace, but we may hev to walk to it
through blood.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a look of benevolence in his
large, mild eyes as he said this.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“None of you goes down far enough,”
he continued. “It’s gover’ment that is
the root of all evil, and gover’ment has
got to be wiped out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We sat motionless around our broad
table, as if held to our chairs by a
spell, forgetting even to drink our coffee,
which grew cold as we listened. There
was an awful fascination about the Anarchist
as he went on to describe the millennium
of anarchy, where there should
be no government, but where each man,
standing as a law to himself, should seek
his own good in the good of his neighbour.
The oration was long and full of rambling
eloquence, whose mixed metaphors suggested
confusion of thought.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Anarchist stopped. “I hev
spoke the truth,” he said solemnly, “but
’twont hev no effect. ’Twill be like the
morning dew, in at one ear and out at
other.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a pause. Then we all drank
cold water to the success of our respective
causes, and shortly after came away.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>All the way home my thoughts and my
feet kept pace with those lines concerning
two reformers who strolled one day by the
sea:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Walrus and the Carpenter</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Were walking close at hand;</div>
      <div class='line'>They wept like anything to see</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such quantities of sand.</div>
      <div class='line'>‘If this were only swept away,’</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They said, ‘it would be grand.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>That was one of the days when everybody
was unhappy, everybody except the
Altruist. But it was against the Altruist’s
principles to let the world know his
changes in mood, and he may have been
sad underneath his smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>It began with the Man of the World.
He came down to breakfast with a dragging
step, and took his seat wearily. His
face looked faded, and his eyes were dull.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish somebody would give me something
to make me sleep,” he said. “I lie
awake every night until almost morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A laugh went round the table. The
habits of the Man of the World were
notoriously conducive to sleeplessness.
Late suppers too often robbed him of
the slumber due his years.</p>

<p class='c010'>The laughter offended him. He rose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>with dignity and went away. When I
followed him a few minutes later I found
him sulking in the hall. The look of age
in his blue eyes moved me to pity, and
I drew the Man of the World toward me,
as if he were a child.</p>

<p class='c010'>I do not know what I said to him. It
was something about changing all this,
and beginning over again, without the
smoking and the cards and the horses.
He did not mind. In fact, he seemed to
like having me touch him, and laid his
cheek against my hand, very much as
Jean liked to do. But he straightened
up again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” he said firmly, “you are barking
up the wrong tree. I mean,—I beg your
pardon,—it doesn’t do any good. I might
have done it once, but I can’t now.” And
saying “Good morning” very courteously,
he went up to his room.</p>

<p class='c010'>I had promised the Doctor to visit with
her a patient on Traffic Street, near Edgerley
Bend. For once even the Doctor had
lost courage. As we threaded our way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>along the crowded sidewalks of the East
End she bewailed her unfitness for her
work. Evidently she was disheartened
because she could not cure the incurable.</p>

<p class='c010'>I walked on in silence, too miserable
to speak. The air was stifling, for there
seemed to be but little space between the
sky and the mud in the street. Gazing at
the faces that drifted past us, some bad,
some apathetic, some despairing, I wondered
which were the more pitiful, those
that had lost hope, or those that had
never known it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Doctor’s mood changed when she
reached her patient and found something
to do; but I, who had not that means of
relief, came home as wretched as before.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the afternoon I went to Janet for
comfort. As I crossed the street, the
quaint stucco houses looked more than
ever like the scenery of a stage. Through
the half-drawn curtains I caught a glimpse
of the Lad, and smiled. The play had
really begun.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>I had come for consolation, but I was
disappointed. The Lad was alone with
baby Jean. He looked up when I entered,
and I saw that his eyes were clouded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Isn’t it cold?” he said, with an absentminded
air.</p>

<p class='c010'>I asked where everybody was. Jean’s
father and mother were away. Yes. Miss
Janet was at home, and had been here, but
was now upstairs. He did not know if
she was coming back.</p>

<p class='c010'>We relapsed into silence. The Lad
took Jean upon his knee. Something
made the child feel neglected; neither by
holding up her new bronze shoes nor by
winking both her eyes could she win the
Lad’s attention. He had forgotten us
both. Suddenly he lifted the child to
his face and kissed her passionately, murmuring,
“Janet! Janet!”</p>

<p class='c010'>I escaped to Janet’s room. The girl
was pretending to read. Her lips were
tight-set, and her eyes unnaturally bright.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know that you have a guest
downstairs?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“It is time that my guest went away,”
was her answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You haven’t a very polite way of
inducing him to do it,” I said. “Child,
what are you doing? Do you know
what you are doing?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She came and put her arms around
my neck.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am finding out what happens when
an insurmountable obstacle is met by an
irresistible force. I cannot consent to be
the Lad’s wife. I am not happy enough.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you care for him?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps I care too much to do that,”
she answered slowly.</p>

<p class='c010'>I was silent for very pity. I knew that
all the obstinacy and incredulity of the
girl’s nature had risen in battle against
this new emotion. Love had come to
her, but had come like a great sorrow.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Of all our protégés among the “People,”
none interested us more than the
Tailoress. The discovery of interesting
characters among the poor was one of
the rewards that we hoped for from our
work.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Tailoress was a tall, gaunt, strong-featured
woman of forty, who lived alone
on the fifth floor of a Brand Street lodging-house.
She worked ten hours a day; at
night she read. From the city library she
had obtained stray volumes of Browning
and Ruskin and Carlyle. Her comments
on these books had marked individuality.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Tailoress had been an ambitious
country girl, and had come to the city to
work her way through sewing into an art-education.
Once she had succeeded in
taking a six-weeks course in elementary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>drawing. The work had been interrupted,
but the Tailoress had not yet given up her
hope. That was the reason why, although
she commanded comparatively good wages,
she lived up so many flights of stairs, and
fared on porridge and tea.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had a peculiar face, with a long
nose, and strong under-jaw. Her skin
was brown, despite her years of confinement
in a shop, so brown that her blue
eyes looked paler than they really were.
I liked to see her pupils dilate when an
idea came to her. They expanded, and
her whole face glowed with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the Tailoress had the soul of a
poet. Through all her starved life she
had carefully saved up every semblance
of beauty that had fallen to her lot. In
her room hung a Carlo Dolce Madonna,
in a narrow black-walnut frame, and an
unmounted photograph of two Corregio
cherubs was pinned to the wall-paper. She
owned a few books: a volume of Longfellow,
selections from Ruskin, and an
Emerson Birthday Book. The heavy underlining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>in these few volumes revealed
an admiration deep and uncritical.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It looks,” said Janet, with mock gravity,
when I told her about the Tailoress, “as
if a sphere of usefulness were going to be
given me. May I lead the Tailoress up
from Carlo Dolce to a love for French
impressionism? I will take her to see the
pictures of M. Puvis de Chavannes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you choose,” I answered, “but leave
her her books.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nay,” said Janet, “I will take away
her Longfellow and give her Amiel. Shall
the poor be shut off from the sources of
our inspiration?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Tailoress was different from the
other working-people that I knew. Most
of them were weighed down by a constant
sense of wrong, but the Tailoress
never rebelled against the hardships of
her lot. They seemed to have no power
over her. Perhaps she forgot them in
her hunger and thirst for beauty and
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c010'>I remember some of her remarks. Once,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>when some one was denouncing the useless
luxury of the lives of the rich, the Tailoress
looked up quickly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t feel like that,” she said, in her
deep, masculine voice. “Why should we
grudge them the beauty of their lives?
God knows what is best. I am glad that
there are people in the world who can
have the things they want.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We took her to the Art Museum, and
she was as one possessed. I found her
in a room devoted to Greek sculpture, sitting
alone and silent. She rose, with the
face of one greatly moved, and grasped
my arm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What does it matter,” she said, “all
the suffering and the lack, in a world that
has in it things like this?”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was hard to induce her to come away.
“It makes me so happy to stay here,”
she said. “It is full of beauty and of
peace.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Doubtless it was her longing for something
else that kept her from rising in her
trade. After twenty-two years of work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>she was still a vest-maker, never having
shown sufficient ambition to try her skill
as a maker of coats.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now a crisis came in her life. She went
to hear the Altruist lecture, and became
his most ardent disciple. I think that he
unlocked the gates of Heaven to her.
Through the glamour of his eloquence
she caught sight of the pinnacles and
towers of the city of her dreams. Unconsciously
she adopted his opinions and
his tastes. Cardinal Newman’s “Dream
of Gerontius” appeared among the books
on her table, and the Correggio cherubs
gave way to a thin Giotto saint.</p>

<p class='c010'>Her devotion was so extreme that the
Altruist at last learned to distinguish her
from his many other followers. He saw
her strength, and confided to me the way
in which he thought it should be used.
The Tailoress had personal ambition, aspiration,
he said, but it seemed to him hardly
worth while to encourage that. She was
too old. In our attempts to serve Humanity,
we must utilize our forces in the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>economical way, and must work with the
young. It was too late for her to fulfil
her own life; she must learn to help fulfil
the lives of others.</p>

<p class='c010'>She needed, first of all, to be led up
to a higher spiritual plane. There was
something pagan in her thirst for pure
beauty. Under his forming touch she
might grow into more impersonal and
holier ambition.</p>

<p class='c010'>And there was no nobler mission for
her than the liberation of her sex. The
Tailoress was employed in an ill-paid
industry, which was almost entirely in
the hands of women. Already in her
own shop she was looked upon as an
oracle. Could she not learn that, in
helping secure better conditions of life
for her fellow-workers, she would be doing
higher service than she could ever do
in search for knowledge, or in devotion
to art?</p>

<p class='c010'>I, who was still at the mercy of indiscriminate
enthusiasm, and had not yet
learned to let other people’s causes alone,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>promised to go with the Tailoress to the
Anarchist, that she might learn from him
the social wrong from which she was suffering,
and the social mission to which she
was called.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our passion for comprehending invaded
even our friendships. A friend was no
longer simply a friend, but a riddle to be
read, a proposition to be understood and
expounded. Everybody talked of everybody
else, and we analyzed and dissected
one another with great calmness. The
temperaments of our <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confrères</span></i>, their
growth and change in ideas,—all these
matters we tossed back and forth over
many a cup of afternoon tea.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lad did not shine in this work of
analysis. We all decided that he was no
judge of character: he had so little insight
into people’s faults. The opinions
that he formed were most astounding.
To him the Man of the World was a promising
child, and he regarded me as a person
of firmest conviction, not seeing how I
was swayed this way and that by any new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>idea. In those days everything that I
heard impressed me greatly.</p>

<p class='c010'>When we were all together, we talked
of our remoter acquaintances. The Man
of the World afforded us much amusement,
and the Butterfly Hunter interested
us greatly. But when the little coterie
was not complete, the absent members
often became the subject of conversation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Our best epigrams, I noticed, were
made about the Altruist. It was easy to
be clever at his expense.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What I admire most about him,” said
the Doctor, “is his brilliant lack of logic.
He is never so convincing as when he contradicts
himself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Paul has that exclusive belief in his
immediate notion which is so effective in
this world,” said Janet. “The difference
between him and me is this: I can never
believe in anything that I am doing, and
he can never believe in anything that he
is not doing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I defended the Altruist. His burning
zeal for good, I maintained, consumed all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>minor faults. One could forgive him
much for the greatness of his endeavour.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet I could not help admitting that the
Altruist’s passionate devotion to his idea
kept him remote, apart from the world he
was trying to uplift.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is rather an ingenious theory of
living than a part of life itself,” said Janet
one day. “I sometimes think that he is
like a beautiful religion that never saved a
soul.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” answered the Doctor, impiously,
“he ought to commit some sin that would
humble him thoroughly. Then he would
understand better the common experience
of mankind.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I haven’t a doubt that he would do it,”
laughed Janet, “if he thought it necessary
to bring him ‘in touch with the masses.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was on this occasion that the Doctor
made her famous inquiry as to whether, in
becoming too literally an Altruist, one ceased
to be an individual.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the Altruist was with us, we talked
often of the Lad. We rarely discussed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Doctor, because in doing so the Altruist
and I quarrelled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is something lacking in the
Lad,” the Altruist said. “He has the old
Greek joyousness in mere living, but one
misses the touch of the spiritual, the mystical.
It is a nature that is limited to delight
in sensuous and intellectual life. It
has no hold on the Infinite.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is what the Altruist says about
everybody who doesn’t agree with him,”
the Doctor remarked afterward. “I wish
that he did not confuse lack of appreciation
of himself with lack of appreciation
of the good.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I feared that the Altruist might withhold
his approval from the Lad. The two
men stood very far apart in aim and in
ways of thinking. It was true that the Lad
did not entirely understand the Altruist
and his gallant efforts to come to the rescue
of the fainting powers of Heaven; and
the Doctor’s suggestion that the Altruist
regarded criticism of himself as a mark of
mental limitation in the critic, was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>wholly unjust. Yet knowing that the
younger man was not numbered among
his disciples, the Altruist treated him with
great cordiality.</p>

<p class='c010'>I did not scruple to criticise the Lad
myself. It seemed to me that he had
parted too easily with his old faith, and
that he was not sufficiently interested in
my Cause.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He stands for nothing,” I said one day
to Janet and the Doctor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“O yes he does,” laughed Janet. “He
stands for the forgotten art of living unconsciously.
He has rediscovered a lost
point of view.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Janet usually refused to talk of the Lad,
but to-day she took up the cudgels in his
defence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I like that radiant scepticism. There
is nothing negative about it. I sometimes
think that the Lad has more than his
share of the primal creative impulse that
is at the heart of all things. His energy
always urges him forward. The rest of
us are working backward, by an analysis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>that is death, as if the meaning of life lay
behind us and not before.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Janet,” said the Doctor, “did you think
of that just now, or did you make it up
before?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought of it a long time ago,”
answered Janet, raising her chin saucily,
but flushing, “and I wrote it down in my
note-book.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Janet herself was one of our most interesting
subjects at these afternoon séances.
I was constantly tempted into a bit of
analysis at her expense: she was so complex,
so puzzling.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have regretted since our free discussions
of one another. We considered
them impersonal, artistic, critical. One’s
friends, I have come to think, should
serve other ends than those of amateur
psychology.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>While we wrestled with our problems,
baby Jean wrestled with a great many
that were all her own. The difference
between her and the rest of us was that
she said nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>But as day after day she watched with
shining eyes the life in the street below,
I fancy that the question of the Sphinx
presented itself to her in many forms.
Why articles that she threw from the
window re-appeared in the nursery; why
some people passed and did not come back,
while others came back so often; why the
big dog ran when the little dog chased him,—all
these things were to her parts of an
encompassing mystery.</p>

<p class='c010'>Her vague wonder grew into childish
thought. I watched—with a guilty feeling
that I was neglecting the great things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>I had been set to do—her quick development.</p>

<p class='c010'>She found that putting her fingers in her
ears kept out unpleasant sound, and once
when her mother reproved her she held
them there, triumphant and unhearing.
She found that she could agitate the entire
family by hiding small possessions. And
she did this often, looking inscrutable and
dignified through the search for the lost
articles, then always bringing them back
when the fun was over. She never forgot.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ways of life were hard for her
tiny feet. She was quick-tempered, easily
angered, and easily hurt. But always, after
running away in wrath and tears, she would
be back again in a minute with a solemn
little face uplifted to be kissed.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was born in an age of denial, and
her first spoken word was “no.” With a
sweet perversity she stoutly repudiated all
her most ardent wishes. Even while her
arms were stretched out to reach the desire
of her heart, she always protested that she
did not want it.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>I think that I remember every one of
her pretty attitudes, the turn of her head,
the curves of her lithe little body.</p>

<p class='c010'>I remember her as she looked one morning,
tiptoe in her bed. It was very early;
all the world was asleep. She had crawled
up outside the curtain, and stood against
the window, with her two hands outspread
upon the pane, white as a little flower.</p>

<p class='c010'>I remember her as she clung one day
to the Lad as he was leaving the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You do like me a little, don’t you,
Jean?” said the Lad.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no, no,” said the child, clasping
her arms tightly about his neck.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, this is the baby,” said a caller
who was entering. “Isn’t she like her
aunt!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lad’s eyes twinkled, and he answered
the question, which had been
addressed to me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very much indeed,” he said gravely.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Our literary club, whether successful or
not, was interesting. It embraced hardworking
women who were comparatively
well read in modern English literature,
and girls who could hardly spell their
own names. The effects of our teaching
were varied, ranging all the way from keen
stimulus to mental paralysis.</p>

<p class='c010'>The activity of its committee-meetings
never waned. Here we continued to debate
on Life and Humanity and other abstract
themes. Here the Doctor and the Altruist
disputed with great plainness of speech,
but with underlying good-humour.</p>

<p class='c010'>I remember one meeting at which the
Doctor began with knitted brows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“What troubles me in all this work with
the poor is, that it is external. We turn
and set them an example, and demand that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>they shall conform. We impose something
on them from without—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But they certainly need uplifting,” said
the Altruist, puzzled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” asserted the Doctor, “they need
simply a chance to live their own lives decently
and to develop themselves. Their
only hope lies in their natural human
instincts. We cannot bring round the
kingdom of Heaven for them either by
preaching or by making laws. If they
could have plenty of hot water and soap,
and could be let alone, they would be
better off than if we try to teach them
our ideas.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not agree with you,” said the
Altruist. “They will instinctively gain
more delicate shades of feeling by coming
in contact with us—”</p>

<p class='c010'>I think that the Doctor was really
angry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“For true delicacy of feeling,” she
said, “commend me to the very poor.
We ought to go down on our knees to
learn of them. The kindness, forbearance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>patience, and the quiet heroism of
the poor are almost beyond our grasp.
Look at it! We haven’t their opportunity
for cultivating the virtues,—unselfishness,
for instance. They have none of the modern
methods for doing their duty to their
neighbours without letting it cost anything.
They know nothing about ‘organizations.’
They actually think that the
only way to help is by kindness. As for
us, humanity has been civilized out of
us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The poor ought to be informed of
this at once,” said Janet, “and ought to
be urged to start a society for the cultivation
of humane instincts among the
well-to-do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You do find,” admitted the Altruist,
“a certain primitive generosity among
the lower classes. But when you say
that they do not need the refining influences
of culture, I do not understand
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I mean,” said the Doctor, “that we
are absurd when we talk of teaching the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>lower classes rightness of feeling, for by
good rights they ought to teach us. So
far as I know, the moral forces are not
the result of culture. They work up from
below. There has never been a great
reform that did not originate with the
so-called ‘People.’ All that culture can
do is occasionally to supply directing
power, cold brain force, to the impulse
of the masses. Something deeper than
thought, in the primary instincts of the
masses, keeps the race sane, healthy, right
at heart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is strange to hear that,” mused the
Altruist, “in the face of the awful degradation
and the crying sin of the slums
of this city. Nothing short of miraculous
regeneration, physical, mental, and
spiritual, can save them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it that Whitman says?”
asked Janet. Then she quoted softly:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘In this broad earth of ours,</div>
      <div class='line'>Amid the measureless grossness and the slag,</div>
      <div class='line'>Enclosed and safe within its central heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nestles the seed perfection.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>“That crass optimism,” said the Altruist,
sternly, “is materialistic and superficial.
It simply ignores the vileness of
a sin-stricken world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This question, as to whether the People
are more sane at heart than the not-People
we never settled, for the committee-meeting
drew to its close.</p>

<p class='c010'>When we separated, I went into the
corridor with the Altruist for a parting
word.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am very sanguine in regard to our
club,” he said, stroking his smooth-shaven
chin. “Janet will do fine work if her
power can be set free. I find it hard to
be patient with her unreasonable pessimism.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It isn’t quite fair to call it unreasonable,
is it,” I murmured, “until one knows
the reason for it? We have not yet discovered
that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As for the Doctor,”—he continued,
not noticing my remark, “she is a forceful
woman, but crude. I actually feel
that she does not understand me half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>the time when I am talking. Of course
she springs too directly from the People
to be thoroughly fine. And our difference
in belief would always make full spiritual
communion impossible.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he looked at me, and his eyes
lighted up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have an idea that you comprehend
me better than any of the others,” he
said, graciously.</p>

<p class='c010'>When I went back to the parlour, I
found the Doctor preparing to go.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is one thing that can be said
about the Altruist,” she remarked, fastening
her gloves with a snap. “He may
know a great deal about God, but he
knows precious little about men and
women.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We found the Anarchist at his own fireside,
playing with a kitten. Two children
stood at his knee, and he was telling them
stories, while the kitten made dashes at his
long gray beard.</p>

<p class='c010'>He lived in one of the workmen’s houses
that have lately sprung up on the outskirts
of the city. They are two-story houses,
made of brick, with narrow windows and
narrow stone doorsteps. Standing, row
after row in uniform regularity, they look
like blocks made for some queer game
which nobody ever plays.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Anarchist reached out both hands
to me with a cordial smile. He was doubly
cordial when I introduced the Tailoress
and told him why I had come.</p>

<p class='c010'>That was right, he said, as he seated us
in great wooden rocking-chairs. We were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>starting a movement in the right direction.
Organization alone could protect women
against atrociously low wages and against
long hours of work. They were now absolutely
at the mercy of their employers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There ain’t no animal,” said the Anarchist,
raising his arm in a sweeping gesture,
“that gets so little wage in proportion
to its work as half the women in this city.
And that’s because they don’t organize.
They ain’t got the fraternity spirit. They’re
comin’ on, but in one respect the men’s
ahead. The Brotherhood of Man is fur
outstrippin’ the Sisterhood of Women!</p>

<p class='c010'>“But draw up by the fire and warm ye,”
he added, dropping the tone of a demagogue
for a natural voice. “It’s a right
cold day out-doors.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Anarchist’s large, patriarchal figure
looked out of place in this tiny sitting-room.
His gray age emphasized the newness
of his surroundings. He should have
for a background, I thought, the great
elms and weather-beaten porches of an
ancestral farmhouse, instead of the gaudy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>wall-paper and cheap, stained wood-work
of this roughly finished room.</p>

<p class='c010'>My companion did not look at the apartment.
Her gaze was fastened on the
Anarchist, and a look, now of terror, now
of kindling enthusiasm, dilated her eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>The difficulty, the Anarchist repeated,
was with the women themselves. They
would not band together to demand their
rights, because they were afraid. They
did not want to do anything “unladylike.”
It seemed to me that under the flowery
and confused style, there was much sound
sense in his remarks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now if you,” he said, rising and striding
up and down the room, with his long
cretonne dressing-gown flapping about his
slippered heels, “if you could influence
any shop of ill-paid girls to form a union
for mutual protection of each other, and to
go out on a strike, for their lawful rights,
which are theirs, you would be opening the
eyes of the captive and letting the maimed
and halt and blind go free!”</p>

<p class='c010'>I do not know whether the Tailoress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>liked the rhetoric, but the idea had taken
possession of her. Her face was illumined
by a new inspiration. She looked, with
her high cheek bones and her deep-set
eyes, like an ancient Sybil about to deliver
a solemn message.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Anarchist seated himself again in
his great rocking-chair, and one of the
children—a curly-headed boy of four—crept
to his knee, and cuddled down on
his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“More,” coaxed the boy, “more Jack
and the Bean-stalk.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Anarchist looked up at us with
smiling pride.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is this a grandchild?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no; he belongs to one of my neighbours.
The two of ’em come over to play
with me since I give up work. I had to
do it. What with organizin’ and the conferences
and the committee-meetings, I
couldn’t get time for no work.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I did not mean to look inquiringly at my
host, but perhaps I did, for he continued:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The organization helps us considerable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>and my wife, she sews. We manage to get
along.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I fancied that the Anarchist’s wife had
laid aside her sewing and was getting supper,
for she was moving up and down in
the kitchen. I wondered if she were tired.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Tailoress was rapt and silent, with a
Jeanne D’Arc look upon her face. She
was too much absorbed to hear the friendly
remarks that the Anarchist was making.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m glad you come to me,” he said.
“I’ll do all I can to help on your enterprise.
There’s nothin’ in the world I
wouldn’t do for a woman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To check the thoughts that the busy
footsteps in the kitchen suggested, I asked
the Anarchist a question.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Isn’t the idea of combining for any
purpose contrary to your principles? I
thought that the first article in your political
creed was that each man should stand
alone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“E-ventually,” answered the Anarchist,
with deliberation. “That’s the eyedeal.
This is only a perliminary step. We’ve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>got to combine first to break the bands
of unlawful power. It’s jest the same
thing I said the other night at the banquet.
I reckon I scairt ye a little then?”
he queried, with a broad smile. “I don’t
know but what I ought to have said less,
and yet I don’t know as I had. Those
are only my temporary sentiments.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes?” I said, suggestively.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m a man of peace,” said the Anarchist,
slowly. “A man of peace. I want to see
the day when we all stand side by side,
free and equal, and no man the minion of
any other. That’s anarchy, that is. There
won’t be no injestice then, for there won’t
be no gover’ment to meddle and mess
things up. We’ll all work separate and
harmonious, and every man will know that
his interests and the interests of his neighbour
are eyedentical.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I tell you,” he cried, starting up
suddenly, and then subsiding for the sake
of the child nestled on his arm, “we’ve got
to fight to bring about this peace! The
gover’ment’s on our shoulders, and it’s got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>to be got off. That’s somethin’ we can’t
do without co-operation, and we’ll hev to
fight together.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And it’s comin’,” he added solemnly.
“The crisis is comin’. It won’t be long
before the worm will turn. Soon you’ll
see the poor worms of the dust ridin’
triumphant on the whirlwinds of war!”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We had a bit of good news to discuss
over our tea.</p>

<p class='c010'>A lectureship had been offered to the
Lad by a great Canadian university. The
opportunity was unusual for a man so
young, and we were all jubilant. A very
human interest in his success had survived
our exhaustive analysis of his temperament.
We talked much of his future.</p>

<p class='c010'>A week went by. Then the Lad read
me a letter that gave me bitter disappointment.
The honour was lost, and
that through the Lad’s own action.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had written, before accepting, that
he was not an orthodox churchman. The
authorities had replied that he could not
then instruct their youth.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That boy has a great deal more religion
than he thinks he has,” the Doctor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>grumbled. “I should like to know where
the university will get a stronger influence
for good.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Altruist shook his head. “His
character has a certain nobility,” he said,
“but he lacks the supreme touch of definite
belief. The loftiest souls are sure.
But I think the university wrong in confusing
spiritual instinct with intellectual
power.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Altruist was curiously radical in
some of his views.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even I gave the Lad only half-hearted
approval. He had but his brains and his
forth-coming book to win his way for him,
and I could not help wondering if the
confession had been necessary.</p>

<p class='c010'>Janet was the only one of us who
thoroughly liked the action.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He could not have done anything
else, being the man he is,” she said
proudly. “He is the most delicately
honest human being I have ever known.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gradually, as we went on talking, we
decided that the step was worthy of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>admiration. It was characteristic of a
nature, we said, whose chief charm was
a peculiar directness, mental and moral.
In this lay the Lad’s great strength.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lad lost much in this transaction,
but he gained more. It was a bold stroke
in the battle of love. Janet was warm in
her praise, and the Lad’s face began to
wear a half-triumphant smile, most unbecoming
in one whose hope of advancement
had been lost.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was then that the Altruist and I
broke down another wall of reserve, and
grew confidential over the unfinished love-story.
The confession of this shames me.
Hitherto we had kept it sacred from discussion.
I was surprised to find that the
Altruist was as eager as I for its happy
completion. In our spare moments we
made many plans for “the children,” as
we called them. The Altruist and I
were beginning to feel old.</p>

<p class='c010'>Often the Altruist, in a musing vein,
interpreted to me the spiritual significance
of the simple romance.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“It is said that we walk blindly in this
world, and cannot tell what the events of
life mean. But see the way in which
Janet’s nature changes under this influence!
Can we doubt that her past unhappiness
was sent to make her future
happiness deeper? Ah, we do see and
share the thoughts of God!”</p>

<p class='c010'>I looked at the Altruist dubiously.
Sometimes I thought he understood
God’s plans too well. Then I reflected,
and decided that he was right. In the
shaping of Janet’s life I was confident
that I too could read the design of the
Almighty.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>“At parting—Andres—said to Don Quixote, ‘For
the love of God, Signor Knight-errant, if ever you meet
me again, though you see me beaten to pieces, do not
come with your help, but leave me to my fate, which
cannot be so bad but that it will be made worse by your
worship.’”—<span class='sc'>Cervantes.</span></p>

<p class='c009'>The Tailoress learned her lesson well.
She listened to the Anarchist until she
was convinced that the hard conditions of
her class were due, not as she had always
thought, to the will of God, but to the selfishness
of man, and that it was her duty to
lead her fellow-workers in rebellion.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was shrinking, timid, sensitive, but
she nerved herself to her task.</p>

<p class='c010'>She began by forming a union in her
own shop. It spread rapidly, soon including
most of the vest-makers in the city.
The few who had good wages joined for
the sake of the many who had not.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>The Tailoress did the work of organization
admirably, and developed powers of
generalship of which no one had suspected
her. Only a little while after the formation
of the union the time for action came.
The monetary depression, which had been
causing unusual distress among the poor,
affected trade so seriously that the wages
of garment-makers were cut down everywhere
throughout the city. The vest-makers
suffered with the rest.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Tailoress acted as spokeswoman
in the committee appointed by her union
to wait on the contractors for this kind
of work. To each she stated her case of
grievances admirably, but no one of them
gave her assurance of redress.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then she led the vest-makers triumphantly
out on a strike.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have not the heart to give the details
of the fight that followed. It was a case
where the employers won a speedy victory,
because of the ease with which this work
can be secured. In a few days many of
the contractors had filled their shops with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>new employés, and the work was going on
as usual, while the Tailoress and her followers
were adrift. Nothing had been ripe
for the revolt except the enthusiasm of the
rebels.</p>

<p class='c010'>I had been sorely puzzled by the problem.
The cause I felt was just, but I
found it difficult to face the idea of the
misery that failure would bring. I was
hardly heroic enough to agree with the Altruist
and the Anarchist that the defeated
strikers would be sufficiently rewarded by
the martyr’s consolation of suffering gloriously
for their faith. Possibly this was
because I was acquainted with some of
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The battle was lost, and the Tailoress
was broken-hearted. Her Jeanne D’Arc
courage left her. In her consciousness of
the wretchedness she had caused, she forgot
that her impulse had been noble. She
shrank from the prophetess into a nervous,
hysterical woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>We tried every method of consolation.
The practical came first, and we laboured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>incessantly, seeking employment for the
vest-makers thrown out of work. Two
shops, after slight intercession, took back
their employés, in spite of the prejudice
roused by the union. Many of the women
were successful in securing new work of
a lower grade.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Altruist, I discovered in an indirect
way, sacrificed a large part of his private
income in providing for the many who
could find no employment. The excitement
of the occasion afforded him a kind
of painful happiness. The war of liberation
had begun. He gave a lecture in
his auditorium on “The Defeat that is
Success.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am really beginning to sway these
young working-men,” he confided to me
exultantly afterward. “The labour-movement
will lose its chief danger if men who
occupy neutral ground between the two
parties in the struggle can act as mediators.
It is full of noble impulse that
often acts irrationally, and needs judicious
guidance. The labourer fails in presenting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>his claims in the right way because
he cannot think logically or speak efficiently.
I am coming to think that my
mission is to interpret the mind of the
working-man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Doctor, though she breathed out
many imprecations against the strike,
helped a score of its stranded victims.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think that this kind of protest
against injustice is always wrong?” I asked,
rather deprecatingly, one day.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, when it is stirred up by outsiders,”
she answered with emphasis. “With
the labour-movement itself, in spite of its
terrible mistakes, I feel deep sympathy.
In any demand so persistent, so universal,
there must be a certain justice, a certain
right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But her next remarks were not so
agreeable.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot understand how employers
fail to see the trend of all this agitation,
and to realize that great concessions must
be made to the working-men. The peace
of the country is menaced, yet the question
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>at issue is left, in times of outbreak to the
military, in times of quiet to professional
agitators, a class of vagrants who represent
neither labour nor capital, and understand
the position of neither employer nor
employé. The burden of responsibility
which the business men of the country
refuse to shoulder is taken up by men like
our friends the Anarchist and the Young
Reformer. The greatest danger lies there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I smiled, thinking that possibly many of
the agitators were, like the Anarchist, not
so dangerous as they tried to be.</p>

<p class='c010'>The news of the relief for her companions
in revolt affected the Tailoress
but slightly. She shut herself up in her
garret room with her remorse. We visited
her, and attempted consolation, but to no
effect.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last she softened a little. One day
the Altruist came to me with a grieved
look.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you ask the Doctor to go and talk
with the Tailoress?” he said gently. “I
think the Doctor might reach her as none
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>of the rest can. I seem to have lost all
influence over her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I promised to fulfil the request.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not understand,” said the Altruist
wistfully, “why I cannot touch people
at times like this. Before this grief came,
the Tailoress hung on every word I said.
I sometimes feel a sense of lack, as if
I cannot get near simple human moods.
It is much easier for me to cope with
intellectual difficulties.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>“Our elaborate schemes for helping
people are making us forget,” said the
Doctor one day, “that the one thing human
beings want is human sympathy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To this I assented readily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the first place,” she continued, with
a thoughtful air, “through all this machinery
of leagues and clubs and organizations
we are beginning to lose our sense of
individual responsibility. As soon as we
find an act of charity that ought to be done,
we start a society to do it for us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But when,” I protested, “has a sense
of individual responsibility in regard to the
poor been so strong? Social problems
have never been so closely studied as they
are to-day. Look at the seriousness of our
young men and women! Think of Barnet
House, and the College Settlement!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“Yes, think of them,” said the Doctor.
“The only trouble with the residents at
Barnet House is that they have too great
a sense of responsibility about other people’s
lives, and too little about their own. Society
has, I presume, as just a claim to a
man’s best work as the poor have to his
interest. Those young men do not belong
to society at all, because they do not share
its burdens. ‘Two men I honour, and no
third,’—the man who works with his hands,
and the man who works at a necessary profession.
But the man who gives up all
regular occupation just out of sheer benevolence
I do not understand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I hope,” the Doctor added grimly,
“that these young socialists may be spared
to share the labour of the era they are trying
to usher in. There will be no more
of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">dolce-far-niente</span></i> of doing good then,
only pick-axes and spades all round, with
maybe an hour off at noon! If socialism
means work by all for all, I fail to see why
those who advocate it should devote themselves
to an existence made of a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>study, a little lecturing, and much visiting,
for scientific purposes, of popular
amusements.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you consider that just?” I demanded.
“I do not know any men who
work harder than some of those residents
at Barnet House. Whether their effort
is mistaken is not for us to decide.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I was not fair,” said the Doctor,
penitently, “but I have been meditating
a long time on the relation of the man
with a mission to the public at large. It
seems to me that no one ought to throw
the burden of his support on benevolent
societies. You can’t take doing good as
a profession: you have got to do good
work. We have no right to palm off an
interest in the lives of others as a substitute
for living ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have given much criticism, and
very telling criticism of our methods of
work,” I remarked in a tone that anger
made only the more polite. “Now won’t
you suggest some way in which things
ought to be done?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>“I haven’t finished my criticism yet,”
said the Doctor, undaunted. “I am finding
fault with myself too. In a way we
all fail, and to go back to what I said
first, it is largely because of a lack of
sympathy. We forget that this is all-important,
and keep thrusting our ideals
between us and human beings. Each one
of us has an abstract standard to which
mankind must conform. It is equally
fatal when the idea is cleanliness and
when it is godliness. I suppose that it
will take a thousand years for us to learn
that we are responsible to humanity and
not to notions.”</p>

<p class='c010'>My silence did not indicate that I had
nothing to say.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The trouble with the world is,” the
Doctor went on, “that it has suffered
from too much lofty thought. If there
had been less of that, there might have
been more lofty action, and closer sympathy
between man and man. We
shouldn’t be allowed to try to impress on
our fellow-beings pure, cold abstract
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>notions. The only legitimate way of
presenting our theories to the world is
by working them out in our own lives.
We haven’t any right to ideals for other
people. I am more and more convinced
that we ought to keep our thoughts to
ourselves, and give the world simply the
benefit of our actions.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is the first constructive suggestion
that you have given,” I muttered.
“It is good. I like it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are making our problem too hard.”
The Doctor was very much in earnest as
she said this. “It is perfectly simple,
after all. We must take care of people
ourselves. No organization should be
allowed to relieve us of our share of
responsibility. The distress of those
who suffer must remain with every man
a standing personal problem. So long
as the poor are with us, and any one of
them needs a cup of cold water, it is
for us to give it, and with our own
hands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That idea is very beautiful,” I commented,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>with hypocritical sweetness.
“Human sympathy is the one thing we
all want. If one cultivate it long enough,
it may become so far-reaching as to extend
to one’s fellow-philanthropists, and even to
one’s friends!”</p>

<p class='c010'>This was unkind, but the Doctor deserved
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Janet worked out a new theory of life.
For a time she had ceased to form opinions,
and I had rejoiced in seeing her ideas
driven like dead leaves before the first
healthy emotion of her life. Now she
drew herself together and deluded herself
into the belief that she had a new philosophy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The trouble with us all is,” she remarked
sententiously to me one day, “that
we are always trying to convince God of
our perfect intellectual clearness in matters
religious, while all the time God, ‘if
there be a God,’ knows perfectly well that
we haven’t the means of getting it. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>wants the kind of answer that we can give,
not the kind that we cannot give.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And what is that?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Action,” she answered, “determination
toward good, even when we cannot
understand the whole scheme of things.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I watched the girl’s quickly changing
face with much admiration and with some
amusement. Once she had mistaken her
peculiar moods for speculative thought;
now she was mistaking her thought of
the Lad for a system of philosophy. She
had translated her lover’s personality into
ethics.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We keep asking questions,” she went
on, “and thinking that there will be an
answer. I suppose that God wishes us
to answer our own questions in deeds
and not in words.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I liked her new ideas because they made
her happy. Intrinsically they were better
than the old ones. But I fear that I
should have liked any thought of hers that
made her face look like that. There was
a light in it that I had never seen before.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“I think,” she said, looking up at me
wistfully, “that all the sickening sense I
had of defeat—defeat before the battle—was
because I stood waiting for a voice
from heaven to tell me what the outcome
was to be. I forgot that the voice must
speak through my own lips.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Isn’t your new gospel of action very
much like the Lad’s?” I insinuated.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose it is,” said Janet, slowly;
“and yet, and yet the Lad is a positivist.
He insists that the present world is the
limit of all our knowledge, perhaps of all
our action.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you do not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know,” said the girl. “I
sometimes wonder if the will to be and
to be good cannot rule in another world
as well as in this. Perhaps the will needs
another world to realize the hope of this.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Won’t you explain?” I begged meekly.
I sometimes find it difficult to understand
the wisdom of the young.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I mean,” she said, “that we speak of
God and love and immortality, and ask if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>our ideas can be true. But God and love
and immortality are not to be had for the
asking. They are true in so far as we
make them true.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So you have solved the problem of the
Sphinx?” I said. “It is a good solution;
that is, as good as any mere thought about
life can be.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose,” continued Janet, “that we
are bound to answer back in act to every
question we can ask. We must rise to
the level of our loftiest inquiry. The first
suspicion we get of immortality makes us
responsible for it. Henceforth we must
win it for ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“O Socrates!” I interrupted, “how did
you learn so much in so short a time?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t stop me,” laughed the girl.
“You may never have another chance to
listen to words of optimism from my lips.
Listen: if we can even wonder whether
love works back of all the hurt of life,
aren’t we bound to act as if it were true?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must found a school,” I said.
“Let me be your first disciple.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“No,” said Janet. “It has all been
said a great many times, but I never
understood it before. The only thing that
puzzles me is the Lad.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is simply fair. You puzzle him
as well,” I murmured.</p>

<p class='c010'>“His renouncement of belief in another
world to work in makes him more eager
to do well the work of this one. His
denial of a life to be gives him an added
interest in this.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I assented, and in doing so felt that I
was making a generous admission. I was
usually impatient with the pseudo-scientific
thought of my agnostic friends.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But remember that positivism would
have a different effect on a nature less
rare,” I added by way of caution.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is something very beautiful in
it, something fine and self-controlled, yet
very sad,” said Janet, with a look of tenderness
creeping into her eyes. “He so
longs to find the most exquisite adjustment
of this life to its ends, to make it
a perfect artistic whole. And I cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>make him say, with my pet philosopher,”
said the girl, looking up with one of her
sweet, sudden smiles, “‘God, love, and
immortality shall be, for I am!’”</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>I hesitate to tell the story of Polly.
She is not fit to enter the presence of these
friends of mine. Moreover, I do not know
her, for I never saw her after her disgrace.
I remember her as a chubby,
curly-headed child; I remember her as a
girl of twelve.</p>

<p class='c010'>But her fate came to me as an awful
confirmation of some facts that the Anarchist
had told me about conditions of work
in our large city shops. I had refused to
believe them: they were too sensational.
I have learned since that they are sensational
enough to be true.</p>

<p class='c010'>The day before Easter I was in the
office alone, examining reports. The door
opened. Looking up, I saw a feeble old
man, who walked unsteadily as he entered
the room.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>“I come to see,” he said solemnly, “if
you knowed anything about Polly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Polly?” I said inquiringly. Then I
recognized the wrinkled face before me,
with its fringe of beard, and I stretched
out my hand to my guest. He had been
my host for two summers, long ago, on his
farm in Vermont.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Polly’s gone wrong,” said the old man.</p>

<p class='c010'>I saw that grief had settled in every line
and wrinkle of his weather-beaten face.</p>

<p class='c010'>He told me the story very simply. Polly
had been restless. They had grown poorer
every year upon their rocky farm, and Polly
rebelled against her narrow life. She had
come to the city to work in a shop, and
after three years had given up the struggle
and had gone away with a man who did
not marry her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ain’t never been able to understand
it,” said her father, looking at me pleadingly
with his pale blue eyes. “It ain’t
in the family. I don’t know how she come
by it. I’ve always thought there must be
something to account for it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“There are many things that might account
for it,” I answered. “She may have
been deceived, or perhaps she was actually
starving, and saw no other way of escape.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But her father shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, ’twan’t that. She had good pay, a
dollar and seventy-five cents a week at
Hempin and Morton’s. She sent considerable
money home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I groaned. Less than two dollars a
week; a dollar to pay for a room; poverty
crying out in the old home; slow starvation,
and the inevitable end.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She could not live on that in the city!”
I cried. “She could not keep body and
soul together. Hempin and Morton’s is a
great cheap, gaudy shop. Hempin and
Morton’s women clerks are kept on starvation
wages, and are told, yes, are told by
members of the firm, when they rebel,
that pretty girls are not expected to live
upon their pay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I was quoting the Anarchist.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must forgive her,” I went on. “I
am sure she suffered more than we can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>tell. I am sure she fought bravely before
she gave up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ain’t never blamed her much,” he
whispered, his cold blue eyes gleaming
with tears. “Her mother was for lettin’
her go. But every year since it happened
I’ve come up to the city for a spell to
look for her. I heard of your place here,
and su’mised you might know something
about her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I took the old man to my home. He
was too feeble to come with me in my
search. Then I went to the only woman
in the city who could find Polly for me.</p>

<p class='c010'>That was Miss Hobbs, the little missionary.
She lives in a wretched court,
in the wickedest part of the city, down
where the great Jewish thoroughfare of
the East End runs across the Italian
and the Portuguese quarters, on its way
to Traffic Street.</p>

<p class='c010'>She is alone except for one girl whom
she has taken from the streets. Together
they do what the city charities call ‘rescue
work.’ Night after night they search
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>through the dives and dens and opium-joints
of the city for the women who are
stranded there. For every one saved from
that life, twenty drift back to it. Yet the
rescue work never stops.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Polly?” said Miss Hobbs, her homely
face lighting up under her Salvation Army
bonnet, “Polly Nemor? That is the name
of a beautiful girl I have been hunting for
for weeks. We will look for her everywhere
to-night. You must go with us, for
perhaps you can induce her to come away.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The search for Polly was like going
down through the open gates of Hell.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Hobbs left her fire burning, and
her door half-opened. Then we went out
through the gloomy court into the street.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the gleam of flickering electric lights,
my old feeling of the unreality of all I
saw came back to me. We were in a broad
thoroughfare, where night after night is
played the tragedy of a great city’s sin.
The actors passed and re-passed. The
scene shifted. We saw the leering faces
of men, and heard the evil laughter of
women. The sights and sounds faded,
then came again, but the curtain never
fell. Even closed eyelids could not shut
the horror out.</p>

<p class='c010'>I shrank back and would have given up
the search, but the old man’s face was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>always before my eyes, begging me to
go on; and the woman at my side knew
no fear. She walked with charmed feet.
Ruffians on the street kicked each other
out of the way to let her pass; the carousers
in every dance hall and saloon fell back
that she might enter; drunken women
rose when she touched them, and followed
her home to the fresh beds that she had
made ready for all who would come.</p>

<p class='c010'>Polly was nowhere here. She must have
drifted still lower. We went from the glaring
lights down where, under the tracks of
an elevated road, the streets narrowed and
darkened and closed in upon us. We were
near the wharves and the bridges.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here is cast up a whole city’s refuse.
Tides of foul life, subsiding, leave here on
the street, or in dive and den, the sodden-faced
women who have shared the flood
of passion in its fury, and must suffer its
ebb. There is nothing lower. There is
nothing beyond, except the river, which
runs foul and slimy here along the dirty
wharves.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>We found a girl waiting on a street
corner, alone. Under the little shawl tied
over her head I saw tears on her cheeks.
I held out my hand to her, and she came
with us. In one saloon a pink-eyed, foolish
woman clung to us, and followed of her
own will when we came away.</p>

<p class='c010'>But we could not find Polly. There
was no one on any street, or in any drinking-den
who looked like the woman that
my old friend had called his “little girl.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At last, with hope almost given up, we
turned toward the Chinese quarter.</p>

<p class='c010'>The odour of incense floating from
joss-houses, the fumes from opium-joints,
made us faint and sick. But we went
on, searching through thin-walled, whitewashed
houses, and climbing narrow ladders
to rooms that Miss Hobbs, in her
work of mercy, had earned the right to
enter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again and again, outside closed doors,
Miss Hobbs stood calling “Polly! Polly!”
No answer came. We heard the pattering
feet of Chinamen, who swarmed around
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>us like rats; we saw their sneering faces,
and heard their chuckling laughter....</p>

<p class='c010'>At last we came away, discouraged.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nearly all night our weary pilgrimage
lasted. When, in the early morning, my
companion said that we must give up the
search, we found ourselves down close by
the water. It was dark and sullen: the
great bridges overhead looked black and unholy.
Even the moonlight seemed stained
with sin. I reflected with bitterness that
it was Easter Eve,—Easter Eve in a world
that was only one great, hideous carousal.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, glancing up, I saw the look on
Miss Hobbs’s face, and my ears rang with
triumphant music:—</p>

<p class='c010'>We came home in the glimmering dawn,
through a city white with Easter lilies.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>

<p class='c011'>“Of Paradys ne can not I speken propurly; for I was
not there.”—<span class='sc'>Sir John Maundeville.</span></p>

<p class='c009'>There came a day that was different
from all other days. Its light, I think,
will go shining down through all the days
of my life, to the very end.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was early spring. We were walking,
Janet and the Lad and I, along the river,
where it winds and curves among meadows,
inland from the sea. The first spring
green had rippled over the country, and
along the water-ways, tiny leaves shivered
on the silver beeches and the tall young
poplar trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>Janet chattered and laughed like a child.
“Isn’t it hard to believe,” she said, shading
her radiant face with her hands, “that one
can be so much alive, and that—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That what?” I questioned.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“That the very air can be made to shine
around us in this way,” she answered
softly.</p>

<p class='c010'>We were to walk to Sunset Hill, and to
climb to its very top. But we loitered, and
the river loitered too. It ran so lazily between
its banks that we could hardly tell
which way the current set.</p>

<p class='c010'>I do not remember that we talked much.
We toiled along in the warm air, with our
wraps growing warm at every step, and we
picked the violets and the wind-flowers near
our path. At the foot of the hill my courage
failed. I seated myself on a great flat rock,
and announced my intention to stay there.</p>

<p class='c010'>My two young friends remonstrated.
They would wait until I was rested, and
would help me all the way. But I could not
and would not go, for I wished to be alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>So I sent them off together, up the hill.
They had taken off their hats, and were
walking bare-headed. The wind was blowing
the Lad’s dark hair away from his forehead,
and was fluttering in the folds of
Janet’s gown.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Looking across the rolling country I
rested as I had not rested for months.
There were hints of blossom among the
cool, pale greens of grass and trees. I forgot
my winter and my suffering poor, as
the earth had forgotten its past in the
glory of another spring.</p>

<p class='c010'>All the knowledge of sin and of unholiness
that the winter had brought me was
annulled by the picture before me, of
Janet and the Lad climbing bravely up
the hill. How young and strong, how
happy they were! What promise and hope
lay in love like that!</p>

<p class='c010'>For I knew, I know not how, that the
crisis had come. I was sure that at last
the unsurmountable obstacle had given way.
I shut my eyes to let the wind blow on
my eyelids. I was content. I wondered
almost that the lovers did not envy me,
for I shared the lives of both; both sides
of the story were mine.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just once I opened my eyes and looked.
The pilgrims were standing at the end of
the long green slope, against the pale blue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>sky. I saw the Lad take both the girl’s
hands in his own, and then I turned my
head. I had no right to watch them, even
from outside the gates, beyond the drawn
sword.</p>

<p class='c010'>As I waited, I thought of the fitness of
the scene. The passion and the purity of
that love were one with the encompassing
life of spring.</p>

<p class='c010'>I was alone quite a long time, I think.
The air grew cooler and more cool. The
low, sweet piping of frogs came to me
from the near river and the far-off pools.
I was alone, dreaming my dreams.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sunshine grew fainter as the afternoon
wore on. It was full of a spring haze
that was woven, half of light, and half of
green, caught from new leaves. Presently
I saw that only the tops of the willows
and the young elms were in the sunlight.
The day was almost done.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the lovers came down from the
hill-top, their faces were shining. We
went home silently along the foot-path
in the grass on the river bank.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It was almost summer.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sound of much talking had grown
fainter in my ears. Between our long
discussions I had found time to stretch
out my hands, and to help, in definite
ways, a few of my fellow-beings. The
touch of need brought strength to me, and
clearer sight.</p>

<p class='c010'>The city no longer looked like a visionary
background for a fantastic play. Janet
and the Lad and my poor people had made
it real to me. It was sacred now with
human interest.</p>

<p class='c010'>I had learned to take refuge from
abstract questions in the details of my
work. It was impossible to speculate
while entering the record of one day’s
proceedings, or making memoranda for
the next.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>But I shrank from the greatness of my
task. Each day the cry for help was
louder; each day I knew more fully my
powerlessness. Sometimes I covered my
face with my hands and prayed for any
one of the old family ties to shield me
from this mass of collective misery. If
I could have again any slightest duty that
was all my own! But no; I had gone out
to take care of all the world, and the way
was closed behind me.</p>

<p class='c010'>I found that I depended more and more
upon my friends, caring less, as time went
on, about our differences in opinion. As
the Doctor once remarked, we were all
much better than our ideas. Even the
Altruist, though it seemed to me that his
zeal expressed itself largely in mistakes,
gave me a kind of inspiration. It was
better to blunder than to do nothing at
all.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Doctor was a constant stimulus.
She walked unswervingly in the path that
she had chosen, gradually softening a
little under the influence of a physician’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>life. Her reputation in surgery, I discovered,
was making her name known
beyond our city. I was proud of her.</p>

<p class='c010'>I never knew all the kindly deeds that
she did among the poor. The record of
every one of them is written in her face,
behind the professional mask that refuses
to stay on.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, the Doctor’s friendship was an
abiding help to me. And sometimes in
my work a single incident would make me
feel that for this alone I would willingly
have spent all my effort.</p>

<p class='c010'>As, for instance, when Miss Hobbs
appeared one day in the office, her face
red from hurrying, her eyes shining with
delight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ve got Polly,” she said. “Shall I
take her to her father?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Lad’s book was out. After a season
of anxious waiting we knew of its success.
The best reviews spoke highly of
its creative thought, and praised the mental
keenness and the logic of its author.</p>

<p class='c010'>Rainforth wrote a letter warm with
enthusiasm. He pronounced himself and
his arguments annihilated, and declared
that nothing in his life had given him
more pleasure than the process of being
ground to powder by his friend.</p>

<p class='c010'>Last of all came a few lines from a
famous English scientist. The Lad read
them and flushed hot with delight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I declare! This makes me feel like
a great man,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he announced that he was going
home.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I haven’t set eyes on my old father
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>for over a year. And nobody in the world
will be so pleased as he to know that this
thing has gone through successfully.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He went away a few days later. The
Butterfly Hunter waited with me in the
parlour to say good-bye to the Lad; he
was making a parting call on Janet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must be away in a few days too,”
said the Butterfly Hunter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is it a new trip?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” he answered cheerfully. “My
last butterfly died yesterday. The experiment
was a failure. I am going to
the East for a new collection.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Through the window I could see the
Man of the World, who was standing
on the street corner, watching the passers-by.
His new suit looked very fresh.
The trousers were carefully creased, and
turned up twice at the bottom. The Man
of the World was probably waiting, though
he would not have admitted it, for a last
word with the Lad. The air of the summer
afternoon made him more languid than
ever. It was a pathetic little figure.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“He will never do any genuine living,”
I thought, “but will always be a spectator,
bored and sad.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lad came back with his quick,
running step. He was excited. The hair
above his broad, white forehead was in
disorder as he said good-bye; his eyes
were radiant with pure joy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall be here again in a week,” he
said, as he grasped his bag, “and ready
for the fray once more.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I watched him as he went down the
street. Once he looked back, lifted his
hat, then disappeared.</p>

<p class='c010'>The keenness of my pride in the Lad
almost hurt me. If his mother could only
know him now!</p>

<p class='c010'>Through the growing dimness of my
eyes I saw him in fancy after he was
gone. In his eager movement he resembled
the figures on Greek reliefs of youths
speeding for a prize, and always after in
my thought I likened him to those immortal
runners and winners of the race.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Janet and I came in the next evening
out of the warm twilight, and found baby
Jean waiting for us with her father and
mother in the library.</p>

<p class='c010'>Janet had spoken again of the Lad’s
love for her. We had been walking in
the deep green shadows of the trees in
the park.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot understand it,” she said, with
a little gasp that was half a sob. “The
very air seems warm with the breath of
the people who love me. The Lad has
made the whole world care. Even the
beggars and the children on the street
are fond of me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We sat in the library for a few minutes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>talking of old things and new. As I rose
to go, a boy came to the house, bringing a
telegram. It said that the Lad had been
killed in an accident.</p>

<p class='c010'>A silence like the hush of eternity fell
upon the room. No one dared look at
Janet’s face.</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently Jean pattered across the room
and picked up the telegram, which had
fallen from hands powerless to hold it.
She looked at it soberly for a minute.
Then with a ripple of laughter she crumpled
it up in her hands. She was very
fond of all things yellow.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I went home, and in the quiet of my
own room I said that I would not let this
thing be true.</p>

<p class='c010'>I, who had been walking with the Altruist
on heights where the hidden meanings
of the world lay clear to view, fell into a
horror of great darkness. One utterly inexplicable
event made all life incoherent.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lad was dead. He had perished
in an accident that was the result of his
own reckless daring. For the mere physical
delight of battling with danger he had
rushed to his destruction. A life guided
steadily toward great issues had ended in
a swift caprice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now for the first time I knew what Janet
had meant when she said that there is no
God, but only a mocking will that makes
sport of our hope and our endeavour.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Infinite irony could find no expression
more cruel, I thought, as I walked up and
down my long floor, than in making us
the instruments of our own undoing, in
causing us to tear down ourselves the
work of our own hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>All that the Lad had thought of life
was contradicted by his death. It could be
perfect in itself, he had said so often. Its
completeness lay in finished work. And
now—</p>

<p class='c010'>I turned, sick at heart, from this place
so full of tragedy and of baffling puzzles,
and resolved to go back to the lanes and
garden-plots of my native village. There
in peace and loneliness I would try to
forget all that I had known here, even
this little story.</p>

<p class='c010'>But oh, the pity of it! The Lad had
walked with so firm a tread. I had thought
of him as one real, moving among the shows
of things, where we groped our way, uncertain
of the path.</p>

<p class='c010'>All through the winter, against the dark
background of my new knowledge of evil,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>I had seen him, strong in body and alert
in mind, with a heart like the heart of
a little child. Often, in thinking of him,
I had said: “God now and then sends a
man into the world who stands as a
promise to the race.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I thought of Janet, and I cried out to
know the meaning of the world’s great
waste of human pain.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Altruist explained it all to me the
next day.</p>

<p class='c010'>He came to ask me to visit Janet. I
had not dared to go. He was surprised
and grieved by my mood.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The meaning of this sorrow is very
clear,” he said gently, with the old ecstatic
gleam in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You explained everything very differently
a few weeks ago,” I said rebelliously,
when he had finished. “You told me then,
and I believed you, that God was leading
that girl out of her mental tangles into
simple human happiness.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did I?” said the Altruist, dreamily.
“It all looks different to me now.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>“I can see that it does,” I retorted in
anger.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The shock will carry Janet out of her
old, cheap pessimism into conviction and
into action of some kind. She will merge
her individual experience in the general
life. She will lose herself in great ideas.
Now, at the crisis of so many great questions,
she will find her work. I can see a
career for her infinitely more lofty than
she could have had if this sad event had
not occurred.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here the Doctor entered, interrupting
the words of prophecy.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XLI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I was sorry that the Doctor had arrived
in time to catch the Altruist’s last remarks.
She waited until he was gone,
then sank wearily into a chair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How the angels in heaven must smile
at that man’s assurance,” she exclaimed.
“I wish, I wish he could tell the difference
between his voice and the voice of
God!”</p>

<p class='c010'>I was in no mood to defend the Altruist,
and so said nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If the Altruist knows what all this
trouble means, he knows a great deal
more than I do,” she went on grimly. “I
cannot see, I cannot see how the Lad
could so forget all the people who cared
for him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The sentence ended in a half sob that
almost frightened me. It had never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>occurred to me that the Doctor could
shed tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you seen Janet?” I asked,
attempting to change the subject. I
succeeded only in turning the Doctor’s
wrath back upon the Altruist.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” she said, “I have seen Janet,
and I wish the Altruist were in Timbuctoo!
He has been at the house and has
utterly unnerved her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is hard to believe, even of the Altruist.
How do you suppose he greeted that
hurt child? ‘Janet,’ he said, ‘I have
always had an intuition that you were
not meant for mere happiness.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>I groaned. “He doesn’t mean to be
cruel,” I said, “but he has not the simple
instinct—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A few of the simpler human instincts
are really necessary,” interrupted the Doctor,
“in any attempt to help human beings.
If the Altruist had more feeling and less
transcendentalism, it would be better.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It isn’t a week,” I responded, “since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>he had an intuition of a directly opposite
kind. And then I was trying to help
him,” I confessed, for a sudden sense of
guilt overcame me as I met the Doctor’s
clear eyes, “in his attempt to explain to
God what He means.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The fierce expression in her face was
changing into a look of tenderness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go to see the child,” she said huskily,
“to-morrow, not to-day. She will be
quieter then.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But I waited two long days. The hours
were tedious and dull and heavy, full of
cloud and rain. No birds were singing in
the sunless air, and the grass had forgotten
to grow. It seemed to me that in
the ending of a life dear to me, all life
had paused.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XLII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“For the agony of the world’s struggle is the very
life of God. Were He mere spectator, perhaps He too
would call life cruel. But in the unity of our lives with
His, our joy is His joy; our pain is His.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I do not know what incoherent words I
was saying. Janet stopped me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, don’t,” she said. “I do not feel
like that. You need not be sorry for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Her voice was very quiet, and her face
was firm with the exalted, unnatural self-control
of extreme grief.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know?” she said, “the sorrow
almost rests me. I have had so much of
the bitter and meaningless pain. Perhaps
my quarrel with life is over.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But this is so inexplicable,” I cried,
taking the girl’s hands in mine and forgetting
that I was there to comfort her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It doesn’t need to be explained, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>it hurts, and the hurt is life, and
life is good. Oh, I tell you,” she added
proudly, drawing her hands away and
going over to seat herself by the window;
“it is only when you are standing outside,
looking at life, talking about it and
thinking about it, that you can say it is
cruel. When you are really living, the
very hurt is glorious.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I sat and watched the tearless face.
The girl had been carried beyond me,
out into the deeps of life where my words
of help could not reach her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have always been trying to reason
out the meaning of things,” she said, turning
quickly toward me, “and nobody even
told me that it is only what cannot be said
that makes life worth while.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“People have tried to, Janet,” I said
softly, “but that is one of the things
that cannot be told.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There isn’t any kind of pain,” she said
slowly, “that can equal the joy of simple
human love.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I forgot my rebellion of the night before.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>I bowed my head in the presence of this
power for whose better apprehending we
covet the very agony and pain of life.
We follow swiftly to let even its shadow
fall upon us, for if ‘in its face is light,
in its shadow there is healing too.’</p>

<p class='c010'>The sunshine falling through the window
turned Janet’s hair into a halo of
waving strands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Child,” I whispered, “it is true. It is
good just to live. But remember also that
the old faith may be true. God may be,
and may be love.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know,” said the girl, looking
up. “I haven’t any opinions.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then a mist came over her eyes, for
even her new comfort was swept away by
the waves of her sorrow; and she bowed
her head upon her hands with the cry that
has ever been the one irrefutable witness
to His presence: “O my God!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XLIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We are all busy still, and yet the world
is not saved.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Anarchist is perfecting the process
that shall bring his millennium to be, and
the young Socialists in Barnet House are
working out the details of their new economic
order. The Altruist still translates
the infinite into finite terms; the Young
Reformer is on the platform; I toil daily
in the self-same Cause, but the world is
not saved.</p>

<p class='c010'>Many times since we closed ranks and
marched onward over the Lad’s grave I
have paused, disheartened. Full assurance
has not been granted me, and it is
my lot in doing battle to strike often in
the dark. Yet I have moments when I
know that the strife is not in vain. In
these I wonder why we are so troubled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>about our duty to our fellow-man, and
about our knowledge of God. The one
command in regard to our neighbour is
not obscure. And our foreboding lest our
faith in God shall escape us seems futile,
inasmuch as we cannot escape from our
faith.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a study of the inner workings of the human heart, and if the
motives of a soul were ever laid bare, it has been done in ‘The Wings of
Icarus.’... A good story, told in an intensely natural and interesting
manner.”—<cite>Providence News.</cite></p>

<p class='c010'>“In ‘The Wings of Icarus,’ Laurence Alma Tadema has given us a
book which, for its literary excellence and for its exquisite pen coloring and
finish in every detail, is as artistic a piece of work as ever her distinguished
father has produced with his brush.”—<cite>Boston Home Journal.</cite></p>

<p class='c010'>“It is at once delicate and forcible, and holds in its story a depth of
passion whose expression is yet kept within the limits of a true refinement.”—<cite>Philadelphia
Evening Bulletin.</cite></p>

<p class='c010'>“It is exquisite in style, spontaneous and well-sustained in movement.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a story of Italian coloring delicately suggestive, artistic rather than
strong, dreamy rather than aggressive.”—<cite>Chicago Evening Post.</cite></p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Crockett is surely the poet-laureate of Galloway. The scene of his
latest tale (‘Mad Sir Uchtred’) is laid among the hills with which we became
familiar in ‘The Raiders.’ It is a brief tale, not a novel, and it can
be read through in an hour; indeed, if one begins it, one must read it through,
so compelling is the charm of it. The Lady of Garthland makes a gracious
and pathetic figure, and the wild and terrible Uchtred, the wrong done him,
the vengeance which he did not take,—all these things are narrated in a
style of exquisite clearness and beauty. Mr. Crockett need not fear comparison
with any of the young Scotsmen who are giving to English literature,
just now, so much that is fresh, and wholesome, and powerful.”—<cite>Boston
Courier.</cite></p>

<p class='c010'>“Two charming stories by ‘Ouida’ are included in a dainty little volume
(‘The Silver Christ’; ‘A Lemon Tree’). Comparatively few persons—so at
least it seems to us—appreciate this writer at her true value. We have not
the highest opinion of much of her work; it is meretricious and even vulgar.
But at her best she is capable of truly exquisite writing, and it is in shorter
tales, dealing with an episode—brief studies of character—that she is at
her best.”—<cite>Boston Courier.</cite></p>

<p class='c010'>“Is pathetic, simple, and beautifully told, and those who have classed
Ouida among the forbidden fruits of literature, should read it to understand
what an artist with the pen she is.”—<cite>Boston Times.</cite></p>
